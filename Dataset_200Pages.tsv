White Hot		Sandra Brown	3.93	11620	593	{5: '3501', 4: '4584', 3: '2892', 2: '535', 1: '108'}	When she hears that her younger brother Danny has committed suicide, Sayre Lynch relents from her vow never to return to Destiny, the small Louisiana town in which she grew up. She plans to leave immediately after the funeral, but instead soon finds herself drawn into the web cast by Huff Hoyle, her controlling and tyrannical father, the man who owns the town’s sole industry, an iron foundry, and in effect runs the lives of everyone who lives there.As she feared, Sayre learns that nothing has changed. Her father and older brother, Chris, are as devious as ever, and now they have a new partner-in-crime, a canny and disarming lawyer named Beck Merchant, who appears to be their equal in corruption. Soon, Sayre is thrown in closer contact with Beck and becomes convinced that something more sinister is at play than her father’s usual need to dominate people and events. As she sets out to learn just what did happen to Danny, she comes to realize that there are many secrets in Destiny—secrets that hide decades of pain and anger, and that threaten at any moment to erupt and destroy not only her father and brother, but perhaps Sayre herself. Underneath the rigid control that the Hoyles exert over the town, trouble is brewing. Old hatreds foster plans for revenge, past crimes resurface, and a maverick deputy sheriff determines that Danny Hoyle’s death was not suicide, but murder. As tensions mount, threatening to ignite a powder keg of long-held hostility, Sayre finds herself inextricably drawn into a struggle with striking laborers, her unscrupulous father, and her own emotions over the love/hate relationship that is growing with Beck, a man apparently with his own agenda, and mysteries of his own. As she has shown in the dozens of bestselling novels in which she has combined hard-edged suspense with intense emotion, Sandra Brown is a master storyteller, and in her new novel she is at her very best.	419	August 17th 2004	['Sayre Lynch', 'Beck Merchant']	['Louisiana']	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/710826.White_Hot

Mindtronics! And Inquiry Alive!		William C. Bruce	0.00	0	0		"Discrepant Events take Science and Social Studies to their Highest Level of Meaning These two books offer two different kinds of maps for teachers. Inquiry Alive offers a detailed plan of how to turn average lessons into astonishing inquiry lessons through discrepant events. Visualize, the Inquiry Alive lessons as maps that lead students on treasure hunts. Each hunt starts with a discrepant event. The hidden prize ends in the ultimate reward: problem-solving skills and accumulated knowledge students can apply. Deeper Topic Understanding Most teachers say that it's the discrepant event lessons in Mindtronics that sway students to reject shallow topic knowledge. As the taste for foods other than candy changes, so changes the taste for introspective learning. Think of learning that comes from the relevancies surrounding an unexplained account brought to light through gathering more details, debate, questioning, clarification, and brainstorming. After a few Mindtronics' lessons, students prefer deeper topic understanding as they learn how to follow the more discerning discrepant event clues. Clues and ambiguity drive the momentum to solve a discrepancy. As students begin to solve a discrepant event, they start with the lowest levels of learning: memory and simple comprehension. As students process the logic steps and the conceivability tactics, in theory building, they go to the highest levels of meaning of any topic: synthesis and evaluation. Yet, discourse on method is never the focus. Mindtronics follows the! ""practice makes skill"" path from Inquiry Alive with demonstrative lessons. Cognitive Dissonance and Agreement The books' examples and exercises help students commit to and welcome learning. The lessons in Mindtronics are designed to help students quickly evolve from low diagnostic thinking efficiency to execute highly specific critical thinking tasks. Using resources, cooperative ideas, and supportive analysis students go from assumptions, to data explanations, to insight, to conclusions. Both the cognitive dissonance and agreement turn the seemingly dull scientific method into exciting, clearly defined ways to apply the inquiry of events and issues found in science and social studies. The judicious yet student-centered methods of learning, in Mindtronics and Inquiry Alive, help teachers and students bring Life to the most arcane of events or issues. YES! Non-reading Students can do Inquiry! Non-reading elementary school students may not know what the word investigate means; yet, they own great analytical skills. All students examine, consider, and probe given discrepant event information. Students also form views and try to discover more about the practical details of each discrepant event. Group Therapy By using the interactive cognitive methods in Mindtronics and Inquiry Alive, students shape and sharpen their organized thought. Students' carry familiar ways to explore information; that knowledge, added to the group teamwork to gather scientific investigation, brings a self-awareness and self-belief much akin to the group therapy given to at-risk children and adults. Signposts to Answers and Increased Choices Although non-reading students may need the teacher to read the discrepant events and fact sheets, the students weigh their own theories and other student theories. Students learn how their questioning muscle can mark signposts to answers. Questioning increases choices. Choices build reliable knowledge, given and found. Then students support the most promising logic offered by applying what they've learned. The Pulse of Theories and Guesses Students learn about the pulse of theories and guesses, about trials-and-errors, the refining of clarifications, and how to synthesize knowledge. They now understand and connect their new and old knowledge. A student's individual reflection brings the sharing of conclusions as the student links the knowledge their group learned during questioning and during research and deliberation. Spine-tingling Excitement No one book on inquiry should answer all your questions. An inquiry book should create more questions than it should answer. That ambiguity is what makes inquiry teaching and learning fun and exciting."					https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/929267.Mindtronics_And_Inquiry_Alive_

The Rise And Fall Of The American Empire: A Re Interpretation Of History, Economics And Philosophy: 1492 2006		Rocky M. Mirza	4.25	4	0		"This objective and rigorous re-visiting of the history of the US as the world's super imperiaist and ""mock"" democracy comes at an opportune time. the book explains with logical integrity why the world is finally on the right path when it questions the true motives of Americans for invading Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Grenada, Cuba, Nicaragua, Panama, the Phiippines, Mexico, Canada and numerous other countries during its short history as a world power. Thos emotives, far from being its professed motives of spreading democracy and republican values, are those of military industrial complex determined to dominate the world and exploit its resources for the benefit of a small minority of Americans who owns the wealth of the US and exerts economic, military and political power in the US.  The book begins with the documentation of the exploitation of First Nations, Black Americans and poor White Americans by a small power elite, founded by the landed gentry of Virginia and the merchant class of Massachusetts, Philadelphia and New York. It explains the root cause of racism in the US and the deeply ingrained desire for war mongering in the American psyche. It explains why the positino of commander-in-chief has greater importance to American voters than the position of president and why the primary qualifications for the job of president is successful war mongering. The author takes its readers through the complicit aid of England and France in enabling the US to dominate the continent and how failure of European cooperation and two disatrous World Wars in the twentieth century enabled the US to dominate the world. The author also explains how and why the US media supports thedomestic and world wide propaganda which conditions people, especially Americans, to believe the lies of American governments and reject all objective criticisms of US war mongering, commission war crimes around the world, overthrowing of democratically elected governments, installation of ruthless dictators, the spreading of global terrorism and the arming and military training of terrorists. The widely held naivety that the US believes in freedom of the press, free speech and peaceful expression of dissent, makes it difficult, if not impossible to convince people of the ruthless methods used by the US and its military might to crush worldwide democratic dissent."

Miller, Professor of Religious Studies, Juniata College). ""Komarnitsky's answers are well-documented and carefully considered, and his central thesis is intriguing. Highly recommended"" (Rev. Chuck Jones, Atlanta, Georgia). ""Komarnitsky shows great acuity of judgment and clear-eyed perception of the issues. He does not claim to have proof of what happened at Christian origins, but he does present a powerfully plausible hypothesis for what might have happened"" (Robert M.

No Place to Call Home, the Memories of a Polish Survivor of the Soviet Gulag		['Stanley J. Kowalski', 'K. Alexandra Everist']	3.33	3	0		No Place to Call Home relates the experiences of a 19-year-old Pole who is captured by the Soviets at the beginning of World War II and sent to a Siberian concentration camp in Kolyma. It is a story that is largely forgotten in most history books today. Each prison and gulag Stanley is sent is no place to call home. In order to survive the un-survivable, the prisoners must work in collaboration with each other. Of the unknown hundreds of thousands sent to the Siberian gulags, only 583 Polish prisoners would return, one of them being Stanley Kowalski.

The Mule Shoe		Perry Trouche	5.00	1	1		"A TIME MACHINE COULD TAKE US NO CLOSER! Synopsis of The Mule Shoe by Perry Trouche Give a nearsighted child glasses for the first time and what you'll hear immediately is ""I can see the leaves."" This sudden clarity strikes the protagonist Conner DuMont in the final chapter of The Mule Shoe but it comes with a price. The dogma, promises and tradition of the past are gone. He can no longer go on doing things the way they have always been done. With this change comes awareness of his conformity and acquiescence to a society built on evil. The Mule Shoe is Conner's journey through his subconscious that takes him, past and present, through beliefs and memories to final acceptance of a new era built on truth. The trauma of the horror of combat hastens the process. Like the peeling of an onion causing tears, Conner's gradual descent into his mind unleashes emotions that overwhelm reality. The story is set at the battle of Spotsylvania, Virginia, in 1864 during the American Civil War, but Conner's mental journey encompasses his childhood on the sea islands of South Carolina, the recent death of his cousin for which he blames himself, and the fantasy of life through the eyes of the common soldiers he meets. He struggles to stay in the present but death, and the fear surrounding it, propel him into a dream world of memories, real and imagined. His day to day reality is increasingly bombarded with hallucinations in which the significant people of his past and present deliver a running commentary on his life. As the combat worsens at the Muleshoe Salient, he is unable to differentiate reality from delusion. He creates a world of calming touch to replace the insanity of war, readily embracing the delusion of soothing affection to overcome mind numbing savagery. The final acts of killing sever his last tie to his prior life. He retreats physically from battle as he wanders mentally in search of acceptance and peace. As he has learned to kill in reality, he finds he must do the same in his delusional world. The power to kill is the evil on which his world has been built. The final act of killing a childhood friend is so repugnant that it frees him from all attachment to his past. He accepts peace as he would use clear, cold water to rinse an open wound. Hope for life and peace replaces the misery of war. The Mule Shoe is twenty-four chapters, half of which are in the present, June 1864, and half, flashbacks and fantasy. The historical accuracy has been well researched and the emotional journey based on the author's extensive experience as a psychiatrist."	230	May 18th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7281589-the-mule-shoe

It's Only the Enemy Screaming		Christopher McEnroe	4.67	3	1		"It's Only the Enemy Screaming tells of one man's struggle with faith in the American experiment as the country's first made-for-media war unfolds. Perhaps I would be called upon to fight, I thought. I did not want to go. I did not want to sacrifice my life. I felt remorse for the boys who had already. What would be my family's reaction if I were to go and die? But these are not things to consider if you are in the desert with sand slipping away under your feet, cleaning your gun, smelling the oil, staring in the face of your enemy. The preparations of a warrior do not include doubt. They do not include consideration of the life left behind. The preparations of a warrior consist of absolute commitment, undaunted determination, and complete sobriety. All other considerations are made before the decision to go to war. If they are not, the warrior is doomed. 'It's Only the Enemies Screaming is the emotionally intense story of one man's descent into the psychological underbelly of American culture during the Persian Gulf War. Given our current political climate, McEnroe's edgy narrative of a spectator's view during the first Iraq conflict couldn't be timelier-but his ultimate focus transcends the political moment. It is a riveting, occasionally hallucinogenic, and always intelligent portrait of America's love affair with violence.""-Michael Lynch, author of True to Life"	208	August 3rd 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1528935.It_s_Only_the_Enemy_Screaming

Informed by his deep understanding of the gravity of these issues and the global stakes, 9-11 demonstrates Chomsky's impeccable knowledge of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and South Asia, and sheds light on the rapidly shifting balance of world power. Speaking out against escalating violence, Chomsky critically examines the United States' own foreign policy record and considers what international institutions might be employed against underground networks and national states accused of terrorism. 9-11's analysis still stands as a measure of how well the media is able to serve its role of informing the citizenry, so crucial to our democracy in times of war.	140	December 4th 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38338.9_11
Leaving Prisons: Release Your Trapped Value!		David McCleary	4.85	13	4	{5: '11', 4: '2', 3: '0', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	"""This is a bold, radical book with unequivocal views of what it takes to be a wise and strong leader. Anyone courageous enough to climb to these heights will feast heartily at the more than ample banquets of reflection and discovery."" -Tony Petrella. ""Caterpillars obliterate themselves to produce the butterflies that dazzle us. McCleary thoughtfully and without apology asks you to obliterate yourself to liberate your leadership and give it wings. If you are looking for easy 1-2-3 leadership, look elsewhere. This is deep and necessary provocation."" -Ron Crossland, co-author of The Leader's Voice and former Vice-Chair, Tom Peters Company. This edition of The Flawless Leader Papers discusses many aspects of our chosen transformations, the release of our trapped value. Regardless of the situation, there is always a correlating personal transformation that, if actuated, will enable the leader to propel her organization toward the desired state. When that personal change is ignored, the organization follows the leader into a prison of immobility and confinement, and the results are what we all see so often: organizational cultures securely and obliviously stuck in rigidity, lackluster productivity, disunity, and a general inability to live synchronously with their dreams and objectives. The immovable reality is that if leaders do not effectively change themselves, they will never be able to effect meaningful change in an organization without the organization suffering the diminishing effects that come from the use of immoral and tyrannical force. Authentic and sustainable personal transformation begins with the right conversation centered on the right question. Most of our conversations and questions are unfortunately weak and unproductive, and this leads into frozen forests of stagnation. Find the right questions and the courageous vulnerability to explore those meaningful questions in dialogue, and your path out of your destructive prisons of addiction will emerge."	240	October 28th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7192913-leaving-prisons

Twelve Mighty Orphans: The Inspiring True Story of the Mighty Mites Who Ruled Texas Football		Jim Dent	4.28	1113	155	{5: '524', 4: '417', 3: '146', 2: '17', 1: '9'}	"Jim Dent, author of the New York Times bestselling The Junction Boys, returns with his most powerful story of human courage and determination.More than a century ago, a school was constructed in Fort Worth, Texas, for the purpose of housing and educating the orphans of Texas Freemasons. It was a humble project that for years existed quietly on a hillside east of town. Life at the Masonic Home was about to change, though, with the arrival of a lean, bespectacled coach by the name of Rusty Russell. Here was a man who could bring rain in the midst of a drought. Here was a man who, in virtually no time at all, brought the orphans' story into the homes of millions of Americans.      In the 1930s and 1940s, there was nothing bigger in Texas high school football than the Masonic Home Mighty Mites--a group of orphans bound together by hardship and death. These youngsters, in spite of being outweighed by at least thirty pounds per man, were the toughest football team around. They began with nothing--not even a football--yet in a few years were playing for the state championship on the highest level of Texas football. This is a winning tribute to a courageous band of underdogs from a time when America desperately needed fresh hope and big dreams.      The Mighty Mites remain a notable moment in the long history of American sports. Just as significant is the depth of the inspirational message. This is a profound lesson in fighting back and clinging to faith. The real winners in Texas high school football were not the kids from the biggest schools, or the ones wearing the most expensive uniforms. They were the scrawny kids from a tiny orphanage who wore scarred helmets and faded jerseys that did not match, kids coached by a devoted man who lived on peanuts and drove them around in a smoke-belching old truck.       In writing a story of unforgettable characters and great football, Jim Dent has come forward to reclaim his place as one of the top sports authors in America today.      A remarkable and inspirational story of an orphanage and the man who created one of the greatest football teams Texas has ever known . . . this is their story--the original Friday Night Lights. ""This just might be the best sports book ever written. Jim Dent has crafted a story that will go down as one of the most artistic, one of the most unforgettable, and one of the most inspirational ever. Twelve Mighty Orphans will challenge Hoosiers as the feel-good sports story of our lifetime. Naturally, being from Texas, I am biased. Hooray for the Mighty Mites.''--Verne Lundquist, CBS Sports  ""Coach Rusty Russell and the Mighty Mites will steal your heart as they overcome every obstacle imaginable to become a respected football team. Take an orphanage, the Depression, and mix it with Texas high school football, and Jim Dent has authored another winner, this one about the ultimate underdog.'' --Brent Musburger, ABC Sports/ESPN ""No state has a roll call of legendary high school football stories like we do in Texas, and, admittedly, some of those stories have been 'expanded' over the years when it comes to the truth. But let Jim Dent tell you about the Mighty Mites of Masonic Home, the pride of Fort Worth in the dark days of the Depression. Read this book. You will think it's fiction. You will think it's a Hollywood script. But Twelve Mighty Orphans is the truth, and nothing but. It is powerful stuff. Some eighty years later, the Mighty Mites' story remains so sacred, not even a Texan would dare tamper with these facts. And Jim Dent tells it like it was.""-- Randy Galloway, columnist, Fort-Worth Star Telegram"	287	September 4th 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/550432.Twelve_Mighty_Orphans

Sandiwara dan Perang: Politisasi Terhadap Aktifitas Sandiwara Modern Masa Jepang		Fandy Hutari	3.86	7	0	{5: '2', 4: '2', 3: '3', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	"FRAGMEN sejarah sandiwara pada masa Jepang terkuak dan memiliki arti dalam buku ini. Studi Fandy Hutari seperti menggenapi kerja H.B. Jassin dalam studi Kesusastraan di Masa Jepang (1969). Masa pendudukan Jepang (1942--1945) kerap diklaim sebagai masa menentukan untuk perubahan nasib kesusastraan dan sandiwara. A. Teeuw, Ajip Rosidi, Jakob Sumardjo, dan H.B. Jassin mengakui bahwa masa pendek itu telah memberi ruh lain dalam pembentukan sastra Indonesia modern. Bagaimana dengan nasib sandiwara?Peringatan H.B. Jassin (1969: 7): ""Menafikan kesusastraan dalam zaman Jepang adalah menafikan suatu wajah kehidupan dalam perjalanan membentuk sejarah."" Peringatan itu pantas menjadi dalil untuk kehadiran buku Sandiwara dan Perang sebagai studi atas nasib sandiwara dalam masa pendudukan Jepang. Penulis buku ini mengakui sejarah sandiwara pada masa Jepang tak mungkin diabaikan dalam alur sejarah teater Indonesia modern.Sandiwara pada masa itu kental dengan intervensi kekuasaan untuk propaganda. Wajah politis itu kerap terpinggirkan dan terabaikan dalam sejarah sandiwara modern Indonesia. Fandy Hutari dengan teliti mendata dan menafsirkan dalam konteks zaman 1940-an untuk mengetahui proses pembentukan sandiwara Indonesia modern dalam bayang-bayang kolonial.Penulis menelusuri sejarah sandiwara mulai dari 1925--1941 sebelum sampai pada fokus nasib sandiwara pada masa pendudukan Jepang. Tahun 1925 diakui penulis sebagai fase menentukan untuk pembaruan dalam jagat sandiwara. Pembaruan itu sebagai pembeda atas zaman stambul atau opera. Contoh pembaruan tampak pada Perkumpulan Sandiwara Miss Riboet Orion (1925) dengan pimpinan Tio Tek Djien dan Perkumpulan Sandiwara The Malay Opera Dardanella (1926) dengan pimpinan A. Piedro. Dua kelompok sandiwara itu terlibat dalam persaingan sengit untuk meraih perhatian publik dengan garapan pertunjukan modern.Pendudukan Jepang tahun 1942 menjadi titik balik untuk kehidupan sandiwara dalam wajah lain. Jepang memakai propaganda sebagai dalil untuk legitimasi kekuasaan. Sendenbu (Departemen Propaganda) dibentuk untuk menagani sistem dan operasionalisasi propaganda dengan memanfaatkan fil, surat kabar, pamflet, buku, poster, foto, siaran radio, pidato, seni pertunjukkan tradisional, dan seni sandiwara modern.Fandy Hutari menafsirkan bahwa sandiwara modern dipilih sebagai alat propaganda karena dapat menggelorakan perasaan orang banyak. Penguatan untuk propaganda dalam sandiwara tampak kentara mulai tahun 1944--1945.Sendenbu dalam praktek propaganda dibantu Keimin Bunka Shidoso (Kantor Pusat Kebudayaan) dengan tugas: (1) mempromosikan kesenian-kesenian tradisional Indonesia; (2) mendidik dan melatih seniman-seniman Indonesia; (3) memperkenalkan dan menyebarkan kebudayaan Jepang. Realisasi dari kerja Sendenbu itu adalah pendirian Sekolah Tonil di Jakarta pada tahun 1942. Sekolah ini memiliki tujuan mendidik penulis naskah profesional, aktor, dan kerabat sandiwara dengan orientasi untuk propaganda.Beberapa catatan menyebutkan bahwa sejak 1942 sandiwara seperti menemukan ruh kembali untuk mengisi fragmen sejarah Indonesia. Armijn Pane menengarai kebangkitan itu mendapati pengaruh dari program propaganda Jepang.Perkumpulan sandiwara pun tumbuh dengan gairah zaman antara lain Tjahaja Asia, Bintang Soerabaja, Dewi Mada, Tjahaja Timoer, Bintang Warnasari, Sinar Sari, Persafi, dan Maya. Perkumpulan Sandiwara Penggemar Maya berdiri pada 27 Mei 1944 dengan tokoh Usmar Ismail, El Hakim (Aboe Hanifah), Rosihan Anwar, D. Djajakoesoema, dan Surjo Soemanto. Kelompok ini jadi bukti pembaruan sandiwara modern di Indonesia meski susah melepaskan diri dari pengaruh kolonial Jepang dengan dalil propaganda.Konsep dan teknik propaganda dalam masa Jepang dijelaskan Fandy Hutari dalam tiga media: (1) Propaganda dalam pertunjukkan perkumpulan sandiwara; (2) propaganda melalui siaran sandiwara radio; dan (3) pesan propaganda dalam naskah lakon sandiwara.Dalil propaganda itu kentara dalam pengumuman di koran Asia Raya (20 September 1943) mengenai sayembara mengarang cerita sandiwara oleh Keimin Bunka Shidosho. Tema sayembara adalah anjuran tentang semangat cinta tanah air, keikhalasan berkorban demi kepentingan umum, dan semangat membela tanah air. Pemenang sayembara: F.A. Tamboenan (Poesaka Sedjati dari Seorang Ajah), J. Hoetagalung (Koeli dan Roomusya), A.M. Soekma Rahayoe (Banteng Bererong), S. Yamamato (Kemenangan Tertanggoeng), R. Srimoertono (Penginapan Noesantara), dan Nakao Masakozu (Seroean Zaman).

Veteran of failed garage bands, he works as a repairman of stereo equipment, tending the dying embers of his marriage, and dreaming of bygone days and the music that almost was. When he finds the music he dreams of has been mysteriously recorded by his tape deck, Ray is drawn into the past, to revisit the histories of Hendrix, Morrison, and the Beatles...along with the history of Ray Shackleford. Vividly recreating a lost era that might have been, Glimpses fuses the hopes and dreams in the music with a powerful vision of reality.	328	March 12th 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/379197.Glimpses
American Terrorist: Timothy McVeigh & the Oklahoma City Bombing		['Lou Michel', 'Dan Herbeck']	4.01	664	63	{5: '205', 4: '294', 3: '136', 2: '23', 1: '6'}	April 19, 1995. The Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City is ravaged by a vicious bombing that claims 168 innocent lives. Two years later, 29-year-old Timothy McVeigh, a decorated Gulf War veteran, is convicted of the crime and sentenced to death. Most of America knows his name. But only McVeigh himself knows exactly what happened on that ill-starred day. And despite his conviction, he has never gone on record in any forum to discuss the bombing.Until now. Award-winning journalists Lou Michel and Dan Herbeck have been investigating the bombing for more than five years. They have conducted more than 300 interviews, compiling exclusive testimony from federal investigators, family and friends of McVeigh and survivors' and victims' families. And in 1997 they secured an extraordinary coup: in more than 75 hours of interviews, they persuaded Timothy McVeigh to give a complete account of his story -- from his formative childhood experiences, through his days in the Army, to a thorough portrait of the culture of right-wing separatists and gun-show extremism that was the breeding ground for the terrorist plot. It is the deeply unsettling story of an average American son driven to violence by his hatred of government. And its climax -- the first and only inside account of the planning and execution of the bombing -- answers at last the questions that have haunted Oklahoma City and the nation since that April day.At once an explosive work of journalism and a uniquely American story, American Terrorist will help bring closure to a wound left too long open in our national psyche.	426	May 7th 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/823609.American_Terrorist

Yes, there had been a heady romance a few years back. Then a slew of subsequent decisions, fueled by love and yearnings I didn't even know I had. But I never, ever would have suspected that this was where the sum total of them would bring me. That afternoon a new doubt dripped into my mind. When do you know, I wondered, whether the choices you've made were the right ones? In 1990, Jeannie Ralston was a successful magazine writer and bona fide city girl-the type of woman who couldn't imagine living on soil not shaded by skyscrapers. By 1994, she had called off an engagement, married Robb, a National Geographic photographer, and was living in Blanco Texas, population 1600.	272	May 27th 2008		['Blanco, Texas']	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2827076-the-unlikely-lavender-queen

Evolution for Everyone: How Darwin's Theory Can Change the Way We Think About Our Lives		David Sloan Wilson	3.92	800	72	{5: '274', 4: '272', 3: '188', 2: '48', 1: '18'}	What is the biological reason for gossip?For laughter? For the creation of art?Why do dogs have curly tails?What can microbes tell us about morality?These and many other questions are tackled by renowned evolutionist David Sloan Wilson in this witty and groundbreaking new book. With stories that entertain as much as they inform, Wilson outlines the basic principles of evolution and shows how, properly understood, they can illuminate the length and breadth of creation, from the origin of life to the nature of religion. Now everyone can move beyond the sterile debates about creationism and intelligent design to share Darwin’s panoramic view of animal and human life, seamlessly connected to each other.Evolution, as Wilson explains, is not just about dinosaurs and human origins, but about why all species behave as they do—from beetles that devour their own young, to bees that function as a collective brain, to dogs that are smarter in some respects than our closest ape relatives. And basic evolutionary principles are also the foundation for humanity’s capacity for symbolic thought, culture, and morality.In example after example, Wilson sheds new light on Darwin’s grand theory and how it can be applied to daily life. By turns thoughtful, provocative, and daringly funny, Evolution for Everyone addresses some of the deepest philosophical and social issues of this or any age. In helping us come to a deeper understanding of human beings and our place in the world, it might also help us to improve that world.	400	March 27th 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/159062.Evolution_for_Everyone

Who are these people, what motivates them, and why should you care?Consider these facts: Everything around us is turning into computers. Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer. Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon your TV will. Your car was not only designed on computers, but has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in 1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store are being replaced by the Internet.Hackers &amp; Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age, by Paul Graham, explains this world and the motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers on an unflinching exploration into what he calls “an intellectual Wild West.”The ideas discussed in this book will have a powerful and lasting impact on how we think, how we work, how we develop technology, and how we live. Topics include the importance of beauty in software design, how to make wealth, heresy and free speech, the programming language renaissance, the open-source movement, digital design, internet startups, and more.	272	May 25th 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41793.Hackers_Painters

Whether chasing a tennis ball or protecting those she loved, Trixie gave all she had to everything she did, inspiring Dean and Gerda to trust their instincts and recapture a sense of wonder that will remain with them always.

For years, no remedy--not orthodontia, not the escalating threats of his father, Mike, a washed-out linebacker turned sporting goods entrepreneur, not the noxious cayenne pepper-based Suk-No-Mor--can cure Justin's thumbsucking habit.Then a course of hypnosis seemingly does the trick, but true to the conservation of neurotic energy, the problem doesn't so much disappear as relocate. Sex, substance abuse, speech team, fly-fishing, honest work, even Mormonism--Justin throws himself into each pursuit with a hyperactive energy that even his daily Ritalin dose does little to blunt.Each time, however, he discovers that there is no escaping the unruly imperatives of his self and the confines of his deeply eccentric family. The only ""cure"" for the adolescent condition is time and distance.Always funny, sometimes hilariously so, occasionally poignant, and even disturbing, deeply wise on the vexed subject of fathers and sons, Walter Kirn's Thumbsucker is an utterly fresh and all-American take on the painful process of growing up."	300	October 19th 1999			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30681.Thumbsucker

Not all the poems reprinted here are masterpieces but there is more than enough quality to confirm Lawrence's status as one of the greatest English writers of the twentieth century.	704	August 5th 1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32053.The_Complete_Poems_of_D_H_Lawrence

A surprise encounter with Carlos Castenada convinces her that she isn't living the right life, and his cryptic message sends her back to her beloved Rocky Mountains.

A Fascinating journey into the heart and culture of a reclusive religious community. 
I Am Hutterite takes readers into the hidden heart of the little-known Hutterite colony in southern Manitoba where author Mary-Ann Kirkby spent her childhood. When she was ten years old her parents packed up their seven children and a handful of possessions and left the security of the colony to start a new life. Overnight they were thrust into a world they didn't understand, a world that did not understand them.Before she left the colony Mary-Ann had never tasted macaroni and cheese or ridden a bike. She had never heard of Walt Disney or rock-and-roll. She was forced to reinvent herself, denying her heritage to fit in with her peers. With great humor, Kirkby describes how she adapted to popular culture; and with raw honesty her family's deep sense of loss for their community. More than a history lesson, I Am Hutterite is a powerful tale of retracing steps and understanding how our beginnings often define us. Controversial and acclaimed by the Hutterite community, Kirkby's book unveils the rich history and traditions of her people, giving us a rare and intimate portrait of an extraordinary way of life."	203	June 1st 2007		['Canada']	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2138601.I_Am_Hutterite

Now, after a decade of dark beats and mysterious lyrics hinting at a larger whole, the RZA, the abbot of the legendary Staten Island hip-hop collective, fully reveals, for the first time, the complex, multilayered Wu-Tang Universe in The Wu-Tang Manual.Written in a style that is at once personal and philosophical, The Wu-Tang Manual unravels the intricate web of personalities (and alter egos), warrior codes, numerological systems, and Eastern spiritual ethics that define the Wu-Tang dynasty. Packed with information that reflects the breadth and depth of the RZA’s — and rest of the Clan’s — intellectual interests and passions, The Wu-Tang Manual is divided into four books of nine chambers each, for a total of 36 chambers. All together, the book provides the breakdown of essential Wu-Tang components, from basic information about each of the nine core members of Wu-Tang Clan to deeper explorations of the key themes of the Wu-Tang universe, a dictionary-like Wu-Slang lexicon, and an entire section of Wu-Tang lyrics with densely annotated explanations of what they mean.Elegantly laid-out and richly printed, the book is designed to reflect the Asian influence on the Wu-Tang universe, which, as the book explains, began with a fascination with kung-fu movies but quickly led to serious study of martial arts and Eastern philosophy and spirituality. The book also includes a map of Shaolin; a trove of never-before-seen photos of the Wu-Tang Clan, including shots of RZA’s trip to China with Sifu Shi Yan-Ming, live shots, and portraits-by Michael Lavine, Craig Wetherby, Sophia Chang, and Frank151; and original illustrations of many of the guiding lights of the Wu-Tang universe. For the hardcore Wu-Tang disciple and the recent initiate alike, The Wu-Tang Manual is the definitive guide to the essence of Wu, one of the most innovative hip-hop groups of all time.The RZA's most recent book, The Tao of Wu, is also available from Riverhead Books.	256	February 1st 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/237449.The_Wu_Tang_Manual

He answered, ""I was everywhere that Jesus was, but I couldn't find him anywhere."" Fascinated by the idea of his grandfather charging enemy machine guns with asabre in one hand and his horse's reins in the other, bestselling author Arthur Slade has created a tale of a teenager who finds the true face of war behind the shinyveneer of patriotism, honour and duty.Megiddo's Shadow is the story ofEdward Bathe, a 16-year-old prairie farm boy who, giddy with the romantic ideals of war and desperate to fight the Huns in France, enlists in 1917. To his disappointment, he is assigned to a horse- training regiment, where the only consolation is Buke, his horse, and Emily, the pretty young nurse he befriends. But when he is sent to fight the Turks in Palestine, Edward learns that what he thought he knew about right and wrong, about heroism and courage, and about God and country, no longer holds true.Much more than a powerful and shockingly realistic work of historical fiction, Megiddo's Shadow is a poignanttestament to the terrible legacy of war, seen through the eyes of a character with whom readers will instantly connect. An intelligent, provocative and breathtaking read, Megiddo's Shadow affirms Arthur Slade as a literary superstar."	304	October 16th 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1149607.Megiddo_s_Shadow

It shapes entire civilizations and transforms the world, one individual at a time.  Yet, all too often we allow learning to become just a long succession of the three T s: texts, tests and tedium.  Have we lost touch with the wonders of human curiosity, ingenuity and creativity which will ultimately determine the success of our schools, our businesses and society?  For those looking to re-connect learning with their life s aspirations, Eva Koleva Timothy s, Lost in Learning is an invitation to embark on the journey of a lifetime.

Greatness is not a peculiarity of the past; yet, delving into the past, this work reveals the key to a great secret:  We, like the celebrated luminares of old, are born creators, explorers and dreamers.  This book dramatically illustrates the power of that great potential and the very real opportunity for its realization.  So come set sail with Columbus, soar among the heavens with Galileo, dive into drawings of Da Vinci and discover the passion which moved the masters of an age as they lost themselves in the rapture that is true learning.	72	2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8424017-lost-in-learning
Die Ordensburg	Elfenritter #1	Bernhard Hennen	4.11	939	11	{5: '375', 4: '337', 3: '189', 2: '31', 1: '7'}	 Bernhard Hennen ist Fantasy-Lesern längst ein Begriff -- mit der erfolgreichen Elfen-Trilogie hat er sich einen Ruf als erzählmächtiger deutscher Fantasy-Autor geschaffen. In Die Ordensburg, dem ersten Band seiner neuen Trilogie, kehrt Hennen in die beliebte Welt der Elfen zurück und erzählt die Geschichte des Fjordlandes.  Das Fjordland wird von den Ordensrittern bedroht. Unter der Führung der Ritterin Lilianne de Droy und dem Priester Pater Charles rückt das Heer der Tjuredkirche immer weiter vor, um die letzten Enklaven heidnischer Religion zu vernichten. Nach einem erbitterten Kampf haben sie bereits den Südwesten des Landes Drusna erobert, doch die an das Fjordland angrenzenden Fürstentümer leisten weiterhin Widerstand. Der König des Fjordlands, Gunnar Eichenarm, sammelt seine Verbündeten um sich -- die letzten freien Bojaren Drusnas und die Elfen --, um den Ordensrittern entgegenzutreten.  Nach dem tragischen Tod ihres jüngeren Bruders ist das Mädchen Gishild nun das einzige Kind von König Gunnar und soll einmal als Kriegerkönigin die Geschicke des Fjordlandes lenken. Von Elfen ausgebildet, hat sich Gishild bereits in jungen Jahren mit dieser großen Verantwortung abgefunden. Kurz darauf wird sie jedoch von den Ordensrittern entführt, die auf diese Weise ihren Vater zur Kapitulation zwingen wollen. In der Gefangenschaft lernt Gishild den jungen Luc kennen, einen Waisenjungen, der auf der Ordensburg von Valloncour zum Ritter ausgebildet werden soll, und beide fühlen sich schon bald zueinander hingezogen.  Hennen ist ein Meister der atmosphärischen Schilderungen. Seine Elfen sind ätherische und geheimnisvolle Wesen, die im Hintergrund die Geschicke der Menschen lenken. Zugleich erzählt die Trilogie auch die Geschichte einer Welt in Aufruhr -- die Religion der Tjuredkirche droht die alten Völker und damit auch die Elfen zu verdrängen. Ein interessanter Konflikt, gepaart mit lebensecht wirkenden Figuren -- das war das Geheimnis des Erfolges von Hennens erster Elfen-Trilogie. In Die Ordensburg gelingt es ihm, an dieses Erfolgsrezept anzuschließen und den Leser wie gewohnt von der ersten Seite an in seinen Bann zu ziehen. -- Großartige Unterhaltung mit dem beliebtesten aller Fantasy-Völker! -- Gerhard Schildmann	638	2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2952803-die-ordensburg

THE GIVER (First Series)		['Mario Bernheim', 'Chip Matthews']	4.40	5	2	{5: '4', 4: '0', 3: '0', 2: '1', 1: '0'}	If you could retell the classic Old Testament book of Job, a timeless and universal story touching three major religions, and set him in the wealthiest neighborhood in the country, he would be living as Michael in The Giver.  From boyhood he had a natural curiosity for God. And as he grew and grew rich, his faith also grew. Michael succeeds into a life of luxury and abundance. His beautiful wife and kids round out a charmed life centered around shared family values. But shortly after tithing a half a million dollars to his church, his life seems to be systematically falling apart.  God and Lucifer gambled over Michael’s faith and if he does indeed love the Giver of the gifts, more than the gifts themselves? And one Christmas morning, God gives Lucifer power to take everything Michael has, everything, but his life.  How does Michael handle it? How would you? Would you crumble if your family were taken? Would your faith crash and burn if you lost your house, your job and every dollar you own?	326				https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6082288-the-giver
Peace		Richard Bausch	3.82	936	188	{5: '239', 4: '393', 3: '222', 2: '58', 1: '24'}	Italy, near Cassino, in the terrible winter of 1944. An icy rain, continuing unabated for days. Guided by a seventy-year-old Italian man in rope-soled shoes, three American soldiers are sent on a reconnaissance mission up the side of a steep hill that they discover, before very long, to be a mountain. As they climb, the old man's indeterminate loyalties only add to the terror and confusion that engulf them. Peace is a feat of storytelling from one of America's most acclaimed novelists: a powerful look at the corrosiveness of violence, the human cost of war, and the redemptive power of mercy.From the Trade Paperback edition.	171	April 15th 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2454475.Peace

DeSmedt's ambitious and exciting debut novel, Singularity, mixes a post-Cold-War conspiracy with cutting-edge quantum physics and a century-old mystery to create a terrifying techno-thriller.A secret US government agency, CROM, fights terrorism by apprehending or terminating post-Soviet scientists before they sell the technology of mass destruction to terrorists. A rookie CROM agent, Marianna Bonaventure, and a brilliant consultant, Jonathan Knox, find themselves on an undercover mission to locate a missing Russian physicist. Instead, they discover a secret far scarier than terrorists with nuclear weapons.The famous ""meteor"" that devastated Siberia's Tunguska wasteland in 1908 was no meteor. It was a microscopic black hole that entered the earth's crust--and never exited. Trapped, it may eventually devour the earth. But a small, clandestine group has developed secret technology to capture the black hole. If the conspirators succeed, the world will be enslaved by a dictatorship made omnipotent by the black hole's quantum effects. If the conspirators fail, they will accelerate the black hole's destructiveness--and guarantee the earth's immediate annihilation.

Eumeswil		['Ernst Jünger', 'Joachim Neugroschel']	4.32	279	25	{5: '146', 4: '91', 3: '31', 2: '6', 1: '5'}	"Originally published in Germany in 1977, when Junger was eighty-two years old, Eumeswil is the great novel of Junger's creative maturity, a masterpiece by a central figure in modern German literature. Eumeswil is a utopian state ruled by the Condor, a general who has installed himself as a dictator and who dominates the capital from a guarded citadel atop a hill - the Casbah. A refined manipulator of power, the Condor despises the democrats who conspire against him. Venator, the narrator of the novel, is a historian whose discreet and efficient services as the Condor's night steward earn him full access to the forbidden zone, at the very heart of power. Every evening, while attending to the Condor and his guests at the Casbah's night bar, Venator keeps a secret journal in which he records the conversations he overhears, delineating the diverse personalities in the Condor's entourage while sketching out an analysis of the different aspects of the psychology of power. Venator's days are spent building a hidden refuge in the mountains, a hermetic retreat where he hopes one day to realize his dreams of utter self-sufficiency. In the meantime, however, he continues to pursue his career as a historian, using the magnificent tool that has been placed at his disposal - the ""luminar"", a holographic instrument that can summon up any figure or event in human history. Venator, in a word, embodies Junger's ideal of the ""anarch"" - a heroic figure whose radical skepticism and individualism are not to be confused with mere anarchism. Around the opposite figures of the dictator and the anarch, Junger weaves a hallucinatory and poetic rumination on the nature of history and on the mainsprings of political power. At once tale, essay and philosophical poem, Eumeswil offers a desolate and lucid assessment of totalitarianism by an author who witnessed its horrors firsthand."	384	May 1st 1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/506145.Eumeswil

A highly accomplished man, his was a life of note. Although now known by many chiefly as an author, he was also an historian, Unionist politican and Governor General of Canada. Although he stated that it was not strictly an autobiography, Memory Hold-the-Door provides a reflective, personal account of his childhood in Scotland, his literary work from his time at Oxford University to the famous Hannay and Leithen stories and his extensive public service in South Africa, Scotland, France in the Great War, and Canada. Of great interest are his accounts of key contemporary figures, including Lord Grey, Lord Haldane, Earl Balfour, Lord Haig, T.E. Lawrence and King George V. Known in the United States as Pilgrim's Way, Memory Hold-the-Door was reportedly one of the favourite books of John F. Kennedy.

The Man with the Easel of Horn		Norman Beaupre	4.00	8	1	{5: '4', 4: '1', 3: '2', 2: '1', 1: '0'}	"The Man with the Easel of Horn is an historical novel infused with the fine arts, based on the life and works of neglected master Emile Friant. Well known as a realist painter formed by the Cabanel atelier in Paris at the end of the 19th Cemtury, Friant was a master draughtsman and painter whose works are an extraordinary example of realism in art with academic formation at its core. From his birth in Alsace-Lorraine, The Man with the Easel of Horn follows in the artist's footsteps through the Franco-Prusian War and then, later on, through WWI. We are introduced to the Grand Salon de Paris and meet famous artists such as John Singer Sargent. The novel also reveals the passion and obsession of Emile Friant dealing with love and the question of sensuousness. It's a faithful reflection of life under la Belle Epoque. Very little has been written about Emile Friant and his works, so this novel breaks new ground in the field of fine arts. Professor Emeritus at the University of New England in Maine, Norman Beaupre writes both in French and English. He has done extensive traveling to do research on the subjects for his creative works. His last novel in English deals with Van Gogh in Arles. The author was decorated by the French Government with the insignias of the Ordre des Arts et Lettres with the rank of Officier for his contributions to the French culture."""	386	August 13th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9567932-the-man-with-the-easel-of-horn

Len’s tale is taken up in We Live, in which he is influenced by Mary, a teacher, and the Communist Party, which becomes central to his work both underground and in union politics, and to his decision to leave and fight in the Spanish Civil War. Cwmardy and We Live paint a graphic portrait of the casual exploitation, tragedy, and violence as well as the political hope and humanity of South Wales industrial workers from the 1900s to the 1930s.	885	January 1st 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2147058.Cwmardy_We_Live

Levi was a master storyteller but he did not write fairytales. These stories are an elegy to the human figures who stood out against the tragic background of Auschwitz, 'the ones in whom I had recognized the will and capacity to react, and hence a rudiment of virtue'. Each centres on an individual who - whether it be through a juggling trick, a slice of apple or a letter - discovers one of the 'bizarre, marginal moments of reprieve'.The English edition includes just one section of the three originally published in Italian under the title 'Lilít', tales from the other two sections have been published in 'A Tranquil Star'.	172	September 26th 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/275651.Moments_of_Reprieve
A Developed Prophetic Perspective: A Fresh Look at Prophetic Operations from a Kingdom Viewpoint		['Scott Webster', 'Noel Woodroffe']	4.80	15	2	{5: '12', 4: '3', 3: '0', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	During a time of crisis and God’s intensified dealings with the nations of the earth, our insight into the meaning of events must increase. We must see beyond earthly reality and turn our eyes more towards God in order to gain true understanding. We cannot rely upon insight that comes from man’s intelligence and his rational thinking systems, nor can we depend on the narrow function of a prophetic order that is primarily gift based. The prophetic has to become a more broad and holistic system of insight: insight that is historically analytical to open the eyes to the dealings of God regarding process and history, insight into the impending events and conditions which empower us to live with certainty in the present, and wisdom to take strategic action based on what will be so the will of God comes to pass and is not aborted. To equip the church to interact with the nations on a more credible and sustained level, we need a developed prophetic perspective!	191	November 21st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9363118-a-developed-prophetic-perspective

The Dead Travel Fast: Stalking Vampires from Nosferatu to Count Chocula		Eric Nuzum	3.68	559	118	{5: '112', 4: '221', 3: '169', 2: '47', 1: '10'}	The Dead Travel Fast is about vampires, death, chickens, fear, things that smell bad, the love of a good woman, and germs… but mostly it's about vampires.The undead are everywhere. They're not just in movies and books, but in commercials, fetish clubs, and even in your breakfast cereal. If you look, you'll discover that bloodsuckers have gone from guest spots in rural folk tales to becoming some of the most recognizable bad guys in the modern world. Eric Nuzum wanted to find out why and how this happened. And he found the answer in Goth clubs, darkened parks, haunted houses, and… chain restaurants.  Nuzum was willing to do whatever it took to better understand the vampire phenomenon. He traveled across Transylvania on a tour hosted by Butch Patrick (a.k.a. Eddie Munster), sat through Las Vegas' only topless vampire revue, hung out with assorted shady characters, and spent hours in a coffin. He even drank his own blood --just one more step in his quest to understand the weird, offbeat world of vampires and the people who love them. The Dead Travel Fast is the hilarious result of this bloody, gory, and often foolhardy journey. With his unmatched firsthand experience, Eric Nuzum delivers a far-reaching look at vampires in pop culture, from Bram to Bela to Buffy, and at what vampires and vampirism have come to mean to us today.  And the blood? Let's just say it doesn't go with eggs.	242	September 18th 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/812071.The_Dead_Travel_Fast

Zen and the Brain		James H. Austin	4.10	445	30	{5: '186', 4: '150', 3: '81', 2: '23', 1: '5'}	"A neuroscientist and Zen practitioner interweaves the latest research on the brain with his personal narrative of Zen.Aldous Huxley called humankind's basic trend toward spiritual growth the ""perennial philosophy."" In the view of James Austin, the trend implies a ""perennial psychophysiology"" -- because awakening, or enlightenment, occurs only when the human brain undergoes substantial changes. What are the peak experiences of enlightenment? How could these states profoundly enhance, and yet simplify, the workings of the brain? Zen and the Brain presents the latest evidence. In this book Zen Buddhism becomes the opening wedge for an extraordinarily wide-ranging exploration of consciousness. In order to understand which brain mechanisms produce Zen states, one needs some understanding of the anatomy, physiology, and chemistry of the brain. Austin, both a neurologist and a Zen practitioner, interweaves the most recent brain research with the personal narrative of his Zen experiences. The science is both inclusive and rigorous; the Zen sections are clear and evocative. Along the way, Austin examines such topics as similar states in other disciplines and religions, sleep and dreams, mental illness, consciousness-altering drugs, and the social consequences of the advanced stage of ongoing enlightenment."	872	June 4th 1999			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/238846.Zen_and_the_Brain

Nothing he's done is illegal-and his targets are certainly guilty of the acts he's caught on film-but he doesn't understand the purpose of his actions and the whole arrangement leaves a bad taste in his mouth. Then Graham, desperately trapped in the hidden motives of the CIA, stops a superstar actress who thought she was alone from committing suicide. Lanie Byrne, the beloved Miss L, is perhaps Hollywood's biggest celebrity, and although Graham is feeling desperate himself, he has trouble imagining what could possibly cause this beautiful actress to want to die. This charitable act ignites a chain-reaction of political intrigue and personal danger from which there might be no escape. 	336	April 1st 2007			https://gc.kis.v2.scr.kaspersky-labs.com/E3E8934C-235A-4B0E-825A-35A08381A191/abn/main.css?attr=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZHJlYWRzLmNvbS9ib29rL3Nob3cvOTUxNDAzMy1leHBvc3VyZQ

Adventures in My Beloved Medieval Alania and Beyond: A Time-Travel Novel Set in the 10th Century Caucasus Mountains		Anne Hart	5.00	2	1		This Medieval Princess in the Caucasus Mountains Seeks to Do Acts of Kindness My life adventure is resilience and to find a voice that resonates all of my confidence. Now in my youth just before I will become sixteen years of age, my confidence speaks all about lighting a wonderful brightness and walking out of the darkness of insatiable banalities. With the renewal of spring, the world is repaired, and the gardens bloom in my magnificent Alania. I walk up steep hills and ride far to remember each intimate glimpse of blooms on trees and to listen as waterfalls whisper. We have come up here all the way from Sarkel to remain here in the mountains, close to my childhood home.To insure my confidence, my voice, and my resilience, here I light the eternal flame to brighten the damp room. I am Raziet, now called Serakh. I am Karachaian-Balkarian, and from my grandfathers, of sweet Alania. I am partly Khazar and partly from the peoples that dwell by Mount Elbrus. I am all of them, all mixed together for generations. My many ancestors came from Persia, the Kavkaz, the Steppes, and beyond where the sky rides the moon.I am the tamga of the horse, the orchards, my pet wolf, and the open grasslands. And today, I am here, not where the Volga meets the Caspian, but with our friends and my cousin breathing deeply the sparkling air beneath my Mount Elbrus. We wait in our aoul. We are all of my magnificient Alania, and here now, in this land of orchards to the north, the scent of the birch trees, the patina, the starlight, my venture, value, and vision. Sit at my table and experience the eternal light of Khazaria and the rest of these mountains and rivers from the Caucasus to the seas of Pontus and Meotis. We are all one from many in the joy of life and we are here to do acts of kindness.	324	January 29th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6669739-adventures-in-my-beloved-medieval-alania-and-beyond

Voyage Through Time: Walks of Life to the Nobel Prize		Ahmed H. Zewail	3.85	271	18	{5: '94', 4: '82', 3: '66', 2: '17', 1: '12'}	From a beginning in an Egyptian delta town and the port of Alexandria to the scenic vistas of sunny southern California, Ahmed Zewail takes us on a voyage through time — his own life and the split-second world of the femtosecond. In this endearing exposé of his life and work until his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1999, he draws lessons from his life story so far, and he meditates on the impact which the revolution in science has had on our modern world — in both developed and developing countries. What makes the book enchanting and engaging is Zewail's emphasis on the human dimension and his unique ability to paint the journey of Life and Science with insightful analogies and ingenious metaphors.But this inspiring book goes far beyond the usual province of an autobiography. Zewail integrates the two worlds he equally belongs to — Egypt and America — and, despite differences, he emphasizes the confluence of the two cultures — the East and the West. He rejects the view that the current state of the world is due to a clash of civilizations or a conflict of religions, and suggests a concrete course of action for the world of the have-nots. The book ends with his road map for a partnership between developed and developing worlds. Throughout the book, Zewail takes on the mantle of philosopher, historian and even political and economic adviser.	304	April 16th 2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6058913

Songs of the Doomed: More Notes on the Death of the American Dream	The Gonzo Papers #3	Hunter S.

In this third and most extraordinary volume of the Gonzo Papers, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson recalls high and hideous moments in his thirty years in the Passing Lane -- and no one is safe from his hilarious, remarkably astute social commentary.  With Thompson's trademark insight and passion about the state of American politics and culture, Songs of the Doomed charts the long, strange trip from Kennedy to Quayle in Thompson's freewheeling, inimitable style. Spanning four decades -- 1950 to 1990 -- Thompson is at the top of his form while fleeing New York for Puerto Rico, riding with the Hell's Angels, investigating Las Vegas sleaze, grappling with the ""Dukakis problem,"" and finally, detailing his infamous lifestyle bust, trial documents, and Fourth Amendment battle with the Law. These tales -- often sleazy, brutal, and crude -- are only the tip of what Jack Nicholson called ""the most baffling human iceberg of our time."" Songs of the Doomed is vintage Thompson -- a brilliant, brazen, bawdy compilation of the greatest sound bites of Gonzo journalism from the past thirty years."	384	December 1st 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54247.Songs_of_the_Doomed

CIRCUS RIDER		Peter Breschard	5.00	2	1		A novel history of both the first American circus and a Gilbert Stuart great American portraitWho were America's first superstars?At the end of a long day, when Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette wanted to relax and enjoy themselves, where did they go? Just like the rest of the gentlefolk of their day, they went to the circus theatre, of course. In 1810 where else could you find six hours of entertainment, good food, drink and amiable companionship? Where else could you see the epitome of horsemanship, jugglers, magicians, a drama by Shakespeare, and variety acts from around the world?Do you like a good mystery? Right now at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., hanging next to the Gilbert Stuart image of George Washington (which also graces the one dollar bill), is an unfinished Stuart portrait entitled THE CIRCUS RIDER. The NGA claims the subject of THE CIRCUS RIDER was an English acquaintance of Washington; however, the portrait was earlier identified by reliable witnesses as being a Frenchman, BRESCHARD, THE CIRCUS RIDER.Jean Baptiste Breschard, along with his partner, Victor Pépin, built theatres in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Montreal, Havana, in every major American city, during the years surrounding the War of 1812. The Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia still stands and is the oldest continuously operating theatre in the English speaking world. M. Breschard, M. Pépin and Mme. Breschard were the premiere equestrians in this hemisphere when popular entertainment meant horsemanship. The Breschards and Pépin were the Elvis Presleys, the Samuel Goldwyns, and the P.T. Barnums of their day. Why have historians ignored America's greatest entertainers? Did the NGA make an honest mistake or did they believe they had created a superior circus story for attracting the public to their exhibitions? Combining primary sources and fiction, CIRCUS RIDER is both a novel and a history. Using a cross-disciplinary technique previously unavailable, connections among America's foremost statesmen, military men, architects, politicians and performers, during a time when the United States was at its greatest peril, are illuminated for the first time. CIRCUS RIDER is a novel history of the first American circus. CIRCUS RIDER is an ongoing history.	330	December 15th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10466478-circus-rider

Writers will come away with an extremely precise set of tools to work with--specific, useful techniques to make the audience care about their characters, and that make their characters grow in meaningful ways. They will construct a surprising plot that is unique to their particular concept, and they will learn how to express a moral vision that can genuinely move an audience.The foundations of story that Truby lays out are so fundamental they are applicable--and essential--to all writers, from novelists and short-story writers to journalists, memoirists, and writers of narrative non-fiction.	445	October 30th 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1383168.The_Anatomy_of_Story
Kaddish for an Unborn Child	The Holocaust	['Imre Kertész', 'Tim Wilkinson']	3.82	1420	128	{5: '415', 4: '523', 3: '328', 2: '117', 1: '37'}	The first word in this mesmerizing novel by the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature is “No.” It is how the novel’s narrator, a middle-aged Hungarian-Jewish writer, answers an acquaintance who asks him if he has a child. It is the answer he gave his wife (now ex-wife) years earlier when she told him she wanted one. The loss, longing and regret that haunt the years between those two “no”s give rise to one of the most eloquent meditations ever written on the Holocaust. As Kertesz’s narrator addresses the child he couldn’t bear to bring into the world he ushers readers into the labyrinth of his consciousness, dramatizing the paradoxes attendant on surviving the catastrophe of Auschwitz. Kaddish for the Unborn Child is a work of staggering power, lit by flashes of perverse wit and fueled by the energy of its wholly original voice.

Rena Kornreich Gelissen""The most important book of the modern age!"" Neal Lavon, Voice of America""The most historically accurate book ever written of the first transport of women into Auschwitz--the only book ever written by a survivor of that transport, who survived 3 years and 41 days in the camps."" Irena Strezlecka, Director of the Museum of Women at AuschwitzOn March 26, 1942, the first transport of women arrived in Auschwitz. Among the 999 young Jewish women was Rena Kornreich, the 716th woman numbered in camp. A few days later, her sister Danka arrives and so begins a trial of love and courage that will last 3 years and 41 days, from the beginning Auschwitz death camp to the end of the war. Rena's Promise stands out from other memoirs in mere length of time she spent in the camps. No other survivor from the first transport has ever written about her experience and what it meant to survive for so long as a peasant and a hard laborer who spent 10-12 hours a day making bricks, pushing lorries, sifting sand, performing cartwheels.... From her escape from Dr. Mengele's experiment detail to her surreal meetings with SS woman Irma Grese, Rena tells a dynamic tale of courage and compassion that reminds us of the resiliency of the human spirit, and the power of people to help one another in unimaginable circumstances, be they Gentile or Jew, German or Pole, kapo or prisoner.Used in secondary school Holocaust programs.Recommended for Holocaust collections by the Library Journal."	288	2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386283.Rena_s_Promise
Translating Scotland. Nation and Identity		Aniela Korzeniowska	3.75	4	0		The first line of one of Maurice Lindsay's poems 'Speaking of Scotland' starts with the question: ' What do you mean when you speak of Scotland?' It is in the search to answer this question that the following book attempts to address the issue of understanding the very essence of Scotland, what has made up this complex nation throughout the ages, and how its identity can be understood and 'translated'. In translating Scotland, in explaining what is meant by the peoples who have made up the Scottish nation over the centuries and how their various identities have come to shape the Scottish culture we know today, Aniela Korzeniowska has reached towards the country's languages and literature, how the turns of history have influenced what has been written, and how this literature has been written.	308	2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10707571-translating-scotland-nation-and-identity

River of Darkness: Francisco Orellana's Legendary Voyage of Death and Discovery Down the Amazon		Buddy Levy	4.13	1867	134	{5: '714', 4: '773', 3: '306', 2: '54', 1: '20'}	From the acclaimed author of Conquistador comes this thrilling account of one of history’s greatest adventures of discovery. With cinematic immediacy and meticulous attention to historical detail, here is the true story of a legendary sixteenth-century explorer and his death-defying navigation of the Amazon—river of darkness, pathway to gold.In 1541, the brutal conquistador Gonzalo Pizarro and his well-born lieutenant Francisco Orellana set off from Quito in search of La Canela, South America’s rumored Land of Cinnamon, and the fabled El Dorado, “the golden man.” Driving an enormous retinue of mercenaries, enslaved natives, horses, hunting dogs, and other animals across the Andes, they watched their proud expedition begin to disintegrate even before they descended into the nightmarish jungle, following the course of a powerful river. Soon hopelessly lost in the swampy labyrinth, their numbers diminishing daily through disease, starvation, and Indian attacks, Pizarro and Orellana made a fateful decision to separate. While Pizarro eventually returned home barefoot and in rags, Orellana and fifty-seven men, in a few fragile craft, continued downriver into the unknown reaches of the mighty Amazon, serenaded by native war drums and the eerie cries of exotic predators. Theirs would be the greater glory.   Interweaving eyewitness accounts of the quest with newly uncovered details, Buddy Levy reconstructs the seminal journey that has electrified adventurers ever since, as Orellana became the first European to navigate and explore the entire length of the world’s largest river. Levy gives a long-overdue account of the native populations—some peaceful and welcoming, offering sustenance and life-saving guidance, others ferociously hostile, subjecting the invaders to gauntlets of unremitting attack and intimations of terrifying rituals. And here is the Amazon itself, a powerful presence whose every twist and turn held the promise of new wonders both natural and man-made, as well as the ever-present risk of death—a river that would hold Orellana in its irresistible embrace to the end of his life. Overflowing with violence and beauty, nobility and tragedy, River of Darkness is both riveting history and a breathtaking adventure that will sweep readers along on an epic voyage unlike any other.	324	February 22nd 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9152282-river-of-darkness
My Miracle		Rodney Barnes	3.63	8	4	{5: '2', 4: '3', 3: '2', 2: '0', 1: '1'}	"My Miracle was first started about 8 years ago (around 2000). I wrote about 5,000 words, showed it to a couple of friends, and then put it away with all my other paper work and notes. About 4 years after that I got a phone call from a friend who was working at HealthSouth Rehabilitation Center and told me about a video tape she had found with me in it. Now, up to this point it had been about 12 years since my accident. So, I drove up to the center, got the VCR tape, went home to watch it, and could not believe it was me. Well, within a couple of months the VCR tape got put away with all the other tapes. And then last year, I got a new job at a school working with alternative children and teens. I had only been working there for a few months when the staff received the notice of our school being closed by the county. This young man to whom I became friends with started talking about his book that was just published. I quickly mentioned to him about my story I wrote, but did not finish. He replied, ""Why don't you finish it?"" That was when he reached for his phone and called his publisher, Authorhouse. I spoke to a very helpful young woman who gave me the information that I needed. From that point on I went home and finished my book adding about 15,000 more words. I simply added to the 5,000 words that were already there. It was like I had already formed the outline. For a very long time, I always wanted to tell the world about my life changing experiences, but never really had the opportunity until now..."	124	February 1st 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6356887-my-miracle
Emile, or On Education		['Jean-Jacques Rousseau', 'Allan Bloom']	3.62	3895	258	{5: '987', 4: '1213', 3: '1097', 2: '443', 1: '155'}	Alan Bloom's new translation of Emile, Rousseau's masterpiece on the education and training of the young, is the first in more than seventy years. In it, Bloom, whose magnificent translation of Plato's Republic has been universally hailed as a virtual rediscovery of that timeless text, again brings together the translator's gift for journeying between two languages and cultures and the philosopher's perception of the true meaning and significance of the issues being examined in the work. The result is a clear, readable, and highly engrossing text that at the same time offers a wholly new sense of the importance and relevance of Rousseau's thought to us.In addition to his translation, Bloom provides a brilliant introduction that relates the structure and themes of the book to the vital preoccupation's of our own age, particularly in the field of education, but also more generally to the current concerns about the limits and possibilities of human nature. Thus in this translation Emile, long a classic in the history of Western thought and educational theory, becomes something more: a prescription, fresh and dazzling, for the bringing up of autonomous, responsible—that is, truly democratic—human beings.	512	June 29th 1979			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/326679.Emile_or_On_Education
Stephen		['Gary D. Zackery', 'John Borgstedt']	4.50	2	1		THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE In the deep woods, there dwelt a small band of nomads known as the Peacemakers. They were a quiet people who trusted in the goodness of the Father of Spirits and lived from the fruit of the ground. Because they lived in such close communion with the land, the Peacemakers were a humble people, holding gentleness in high esteem. They were a people made up of many tribes of the old country that had been brought together by the Great Hand of Mercy. In the early days, there were many peoples scattered over the old lands of Ability. Ability lay east of the Triall and was an ever-present reminder to the Peacemakers of the land they were now exiled from. The river was, for the most part, feared by many who wandered in the wilderness; for, it was the great river that had separated them from their homeland. The river was believed to be the curse that kept them estranged from their heritage, thereby keeping them besieged by the evil ways of the Horsemen. Yet, it was this same river which forced them to seek every means possible to live peaceably together. Hence, their namesake. Stephen is a fictional story about a Nomadic Tribe. Based on biblical principals, 'Stephen' teaches life lessons to yearning hearts. Gary Zackery, who authored the book, is pleased to welcome John Borgstedt as co-author.

Scorch Atlas		Blake Butler	3.65	1223	181	{5: '367', 4: '349', 3: '277', 2: '166', 1: '64'}	"In this striking novel-in-stories, a series of strange apocalypses have hit America. Entire neighborhoods drown in mud, glass rains from the sky, birds speak gibberish, and parents of young children disappear. Millions starve while others grow coats of mold. But a few are able to survive and find a light in the aftermath, illuminating what we’ve become. In ""The Disappeared"", a father is arrested for missing free throws, leaving his son to search alone for his lost mother. A boy swells to fill his parents’ ransacked attic in ""The Ruined Child"". Rendered in a variety of narrative forms, from a psychedelic fable to a skewed insurance claim questionnaire, Blake Butler’s full-length fiction debut paints a gorgeously grotesque version of America, bringing to mind both Kelly Link and William H. Gass, yet imbued with Butler's own vision of the apocalyptic and bizarre."	152	September 8th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6260741-scorch-atlas

They dress how they want, go out if and when they please, smoke, drink and generally party like it's 1899. At the end they decide if they will return and join the Amish church.""I am 30 years old. I wore my hair in two braids every day until I was 12. I dressed more conservatively than most Amish, barely left my house until I was 18 and spent the last 12 years studying and working hard on my career like a good little Indian girl. The time has come; you are witness to the dawning of my Indian Rumspringa, a Ram-Singha if you will. But instead of smoking and drinking Bud Lights in a park while yelling 'Down with barn raising!' I plan to indulge in a different manner — by pursuing everything I wish had been a part of my youth. Things I always felt were part of most North Americans' adolescent experience. I will learn to swim, go to summer camp, see Disneyworld, take dance lessons, have sleepovers and finally get the pet I longed for my whole life.""This is the story of the ultimate New Year's resolution, more akin to a new life resolution. Will it all be fun? Will my friends and family support my walk down memory-less lane? Will it all matter in the end? I don't know yet but much like my young Rumspringaed-out counterpart, I will decide whether or not there is any going back."	272	March 22nd 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13373153-on-the-outside-looking-indian

During the 1920s and 1930s, Prohibition-dodging Americans visiting London for tea-dances and cocktails made the bar at the Savoy their home.

AMERICA: Still the Land of Opportunity, Always a Home for the Brave		Jason Howell	5.00	1	0		"This book helps people fight through their challenges so they can see the opportunities that successful people take advantage of in times of crisis. Have you been struggling in this economy? Have you been worried about your job or have you been without a job for more than 6 months? Are you worried about our country’s ability to recover from the “Great Recession?”AMERICA: Still the Land of Opportunity, Always a Home for the Brave was written with people just like you in mind. When I began my career as a commission only Recruiter in 2006, the economy was barely showing signs of slowing down. By the time I entered my second year in 2008, the economy was headed towards a crash. Very few clients wanted to pay me to hire new people; and that’s if they were hiring at all! In 2008 I met so many people that were not only worried about their jobs but who were actually unemployed. Though I was working my commissions had dropped so low that I barely any commissions at all. When my father became gravely ill, I knew that it was time for me to do something different not only for myself but for all of the people I continued to meet who were struggling. Isn’t it funny that financial troubles seem to come exactly at the wrong time? I decided to take action. Two mornings a week I was the guy in the coffee shop typing away a book that would change the course of people’s lives and my own. Every evening at 6 pm I would stop working and start writing the draft of what would become my tribute to people who have succeeded in prior generations and what their courage and ingenuity translated to in a 21st century workforce. This book is my of helping people I met as a Recruiter who needed encouragement but also credible and specific strategies for getting a new job. In it I poured many of the simple but often overlooked strategies for getting a job that have helped many of my former clients.“I met Jason while I was searching for a job as most people might meet recruiters. Since that time, I have come to look to Jason as a resource and a friend. He provides valuable insight on the overall state of the job market and any trends he has come across. Whenever I have a friend or colleague looking for a position…I always refer them to Jason because I know I am putting them in good hands.”- Jake O., Vienna, VA“I never thought I'd find myself in Portland, Maine, but I received exactly the job offer that I had hoped for. I had been sending my resume here a couple times each year since 2005 and I got a call back from them only after I submitted the resume that you helped me with.”- James B., Portland, ME“It was a pleasure to review Jason Howell's book. He has collected wisdom and leadership from our own American patriotic leaders and artfully connected it to our own professional and personal development. It's a new concept, but he has crafted a well-delivered book based on in-depth research. For anyone wanting to better themselves with a better career, this is a valuable resource.”- Darcie D., Washington, DCThe old world of getting a job by just showing up changed years ago. We are now under no false pretense that we are owed a job by anyone. Identifying ways to deliver value is the only true method for finding and keeping employment.

Now is the time to add innovation to your career or business.

Petty thief Birdie Kaminsky has arrived in Liberty, Ohio to steal a treasure hidden since the Civil War. She’s in possession of a charming clue passed down in her family for generations: Liberty safeguards the cherished heart.  The beautiful thief wants to go straight. She secretly admires the clue’s author, freedwoman Justice Postell, who rose above the horrors of slavery to build a new life in Ohio. According to family lore, Justice left South Carolina at the dawn of the Civil War. Heavy with child, she carried untold riches on her journey north. As Birdie searches for the treasure, she begins to believe a questionable part of the story: a tale of love between Justice and Lucas Postell, the French plantation owner who was Birdie’s ancestor.  If the stories are true, Justice bore a child with Lucas. Some of those black relatives might still live in town. Birdie can’t help but wonder if she’s found one—Liberty’s feisty matriarch, Theodora Hendricks, who packs a pistol and heartwarming stories about Justice. Birdie doesn’t know that an investigative reporter who has arrived in town will trip her up—as will her conscience when she begins to wonder if it’s possible to start a new life with stolen riches. Yet with each new clue she unearths, Birdie begins to discover a family history more precious than gems, a tradition of love richer than she could imagine.  The books of The Liberty Series work as stand-alone novels you may enjoy in any order. Look for the other books in the series: Second Chance Grill, The Impossible Wish, Four Wishes and The Tree of Everlasting Knowledge."	415	November 20th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26201815-treasure-me

However, his Chief-Commander, Alrick Zartollis, has assured him that he is perfect for the mission so he prepares to depart accompanied by a smart-mouthed, know-it-all computer named Max. The ""simple assignment"" rapidly becomes complicated when he meets Kate, a young woman who prevents him from retrieving the lost probe. When he and Kate are literally blasted from Old Earth to another place and time, Michael realizes he has been set up by his esteemed Chief-Commander. ""Probe retrieval, indeed,"" he mutters as he surveys his new surroundings and the odd individuals who live there: Edgar, a mechanical servant, who disdains the implication that he is a robot. ""The robot was my ancestor,"" he sniffs to Michael, ""just as the amoeba was yours.""; Jafrey, an irreverent old man with a long gray ponytail, sharp tongue, and a dangerously powerful talent; Nick, the giant Sarzonian monster who can quote Shakespeare; Ivar, the master of a mysterious place called Belencourt, who got so tired of powerful visitors blowing up his electromagnetic door that he had it replaced with an old-fashioned hinged door which was less susceptible to strong auras. Michael soon discovers he is on a mission so secret he is not even allowed to know what it's all about.

Making the Mummies Dance: Inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art		['Thomas Hoving', 'Eve Metz']	3.85	949	88	{5: '289', 4: '340', 3: '234', 2: '58', 1: '28'}	"No museum in the world is like the Metropolitan Museum of Art - and no man has ever run it, or revolutionized it, quite like Thomas Hoving. In a decade, Hoving changed almost everything people had grown accustomed to from the Met, shaking the institution out of royal repose and transforming it into the most vital cultural presence in the country. Now, the irrepressible former director delivers a fearless account of his life at the pinnacle of the art world - a modern Vanity Fair, a true story of masterpieces and money, society and scandal, intrigue and international theft. The Met is more than a dazzling art showplace. The museum is a vibrant if quietly influential community, inhabited and run by singular sorts of people: trustees and curators, connoisseurs and conservators. It is steeped in history and tradition and seems to move in a serene and elegant world of impeccable manners and the finest taste. Behind the proper social veneers and pristine marble galleries, Hoving reveals the cutthroat precincts where the real business of the Met is carried out. From seducing important patrons like Robert Lehman, Nelson Rockefeller, Walter Annenberg, and Brooke Astor to spiriting ancient treasures across international borders; from striking secret agreements with the world's most powerful dealers to sidestepping rivals; from securing blockbuster exhibitions, like ""Tut"" and ""The Glory of Russian Costume,"" to seizing the most phenomenal Velazquez portrait, Hoving shares not only the nimbleness and brashness that made him so effective, but also the zeal and passion that made the Met so exciting. Making the Mummies Dance is told in the head-on, even naughty, way that is trademark Hoving. This is an important, shocking museum story and more - an unforgettable tale of power struggles and one-upmanship, fame, big money, and, of course, great art."	448	February 15th 1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/152883.Making_the_Mummies_Dance

Politics - According to the Bible: A Comprehensive Resource for Understanding Modern Political Issues in Light of Scripture		Wayne Grudem	3.87	441	59	{5: '162', 4: '139', 3: '82', 2: '37', 1: '21'}	A variety of perspectives exist within the Christian community when it comes to political issues and political involvement. This comprehensive and readable book presents a political philosophy from the perspective that the Gospel pertains to all of life so Christians should be involved in political issues. In brief, this is an analysis of conservative and liberal plans to do good for the nation, evaluated in light of the Bible and common sense.In this ground-breaking book, recognized evangelical Bible professor Wayne Grudem rejects five mistaken views about Christian influence on politics: (1) “compel religion,” (2) “exclude religion,” (3) “all government is demonic,” (4) “do evangel-ism, not politics,” and (5) “do politics, not evangelism.” He proposes a better alternative: (6) “significant Christian influence on government.” Then he explains the Bible’s teachings about the purpose of civil government and the characteristics of good or bad government. Does the Bible support some form of democracy? Should judges and the courts hold the ultimate power in a nation? With respect to specific political issues, Grudem argues that most people’s political views depend on deep-seated assumptions about several basic moral and even theological questions, such as whether God exists, whether absolute moral standards can be known, whether there is good and evil in each person’s heart, whether people should be accountable for their good and bad choices, whether property should belong to individuals or to society, and whether the purpose of the earth’s resources is to bring benefit to mankind. After addressing these foundational questions, Grudem provides a thoughtful, carefully-reasoned analysis of over fifty specific issues dealing with the protection of life, marriage, the family and children, economic issues and taxation, the environment, national defense, relationships to other nations, freedom of speech and religion, quotas, and special interests. He makes frequent application to the current policies of the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States, but the principles discussed here are relevant for any nation.	624	September 8th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8982042-politics---according-to-the-bible

Devotion to music is at the heart of this book. A group of amateur musicians, the Boman Quartet, prevents a series of dramatic events from turning into heart-rending tragedy, as music enables each of the musicians to rise above his own bleak situation. There is humour in the satirical, larger-than-life portrayal of the local sectarians, led by the bank manager Ankersen, as they seek in vain to break the spirit of the musicians, as well as earthy humor in Janniksen, the huge blacksmith who is completely at the mercy of his petty-minded wife.	298	1975			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/679839.The_Lost_Musicians

Tresaugue's ""Shadows Beyond the Flames and Other Stories"" proves just that. Within each of us we have the power to do great good, and in the blink of an eye we can turn into a depraved, immoral human being. You find variations of these human characteristics within the contents of stories such as ""The Manual"" and ""Sometimes Always."" However, within ""Graphic Burn"" we are given a glimpse of what being a better person truly means. There are stories that grip us, stories that shake us to our cores, and stories that inspire. The stories contained within this volume touch on a little of everything; from the macabre, to the hopeful, but mainly the darkness within us. You won't be disappointed with the variety of science fiction, horror, fantasy, strange, unusual, and revenge thrown in for good measure in ""Shadows Beyond the Flames and Other Stories."""	238	July 31st 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12909098-shadows-beyond-the-flames-and-other-stories

Passion, Betrayal And Killer Highlights	Sophie Katz Murder Mystery #2	Kyra Davis	3.94	3833	232	{5: '1162', 4: '1520', 3: '955', 2: '153', 1: '43'}	Sophie Katz has just offered a man $12,000 for his services… Is she desperate or just meshugeneh? Considering the kind of disasters that usually befall the half-black, half-Jewish mystery writer, probably both. Because the last time Sophie saw sexy P.I. Anatoly Darinsky, he practically danced a jig when she waved goodbye�a normal reaction for a man who'd nearly bought the farm trying to protect her from her own foolishness. What are the chances he'd agree to take incriminating pictures of her sister's philandering husband? Or that he'd let her tag along�you know…for research? But when her brother-in-law turns up dead and her sister becomes the prime suspect, Sophie's priority is finding the real killer. With or without Anatoly's help. Her brother-in-law's secret life yields plenty of suspects, but the San Francisco police aren't taking any of them seriously. So Sophie does what comes naturally to her: she stirs up trouble (to lure the killer out, of course). But if her crazy plan works, will Anatoly be there to protect her this time?	368	March 20th 2007	['Sophie Katz']		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/421122.Passion_Betrayal_And_Killer_Highlights

The Other Brain: From Dementia to Schizophrenia, How New Discoveries about the Brain Are Revolutionizing Medicine and Science		R. Douglas Fields	4.10	1607	108	{5: '687', 4: '532', 3: '280', 2: '82', 1: '26'}	"Despite everything that has been written about the brain, a very important part of this vital organ has been overlooked in most books -- until now. The Other Brain is the story of glia, which make up approximately 85 percent of the cells in the brain. Long neglected as little more than cerebral packing material (""glia"" means glue), glia are sparking a revolution in brain science.Glia are completely different from neurons, the brain cells that we are familiar with. Scientists are discovering that glia have their own communication network, which operates in parallel to the more familiar communication among neurons. Glia provide the insulation for the neurons, and glia even regulate the flow of information between neurons.But it is the potential breakthroughs for medical science that are the most exciting frontier in glia research today. Diseases such as brain cancer and multiple sclerosis are caused by diseased glia. Glia are now believed to play an important role in such psychiatric illnesses as schizophrenia and depression, and in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. They are linked to infectious diseases such as HIV and prion disease (mad cow disease, for example) and to chronic pain. Scientists have discovered that glia repair the brain and spinal cord after injury and stroke. The more we learn about these cells that make up the ""other"" brain, the more important they seem to be.Written by a neuroscientist who is a leader in the research to reveal the secrets of these brain cells, The Other Brain offers a firsthand account of science in action. It takes us into the laboratories where important discoveries are being made, and it explains how scientists are learning that glial cells come in different types, with different capabilities. It tells the story of glia research from its origins to the most recent discoveries and gives readers a much more complete understanding of how the brain works and where the next breakthroughs in brain science and medicine are likely to come."	384	December 29th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7170963-the-other-brain

Meet Mr. J		Mr. J	5.00	2	1		"Finally a voice for an unspoken generation speaks with acerbic wit and ear tickling vernacular that rings true. Parenthetically, 236 typos (i.e. errors of grammar, syntax, semantics, linguistics, etc) have been intentionally left, not to exasperate a maladroit writing skill, but to accent how frivolous and moot rules can be in creative writing. It's a ""Where's Waldo"" of Errors making it interactive for the grammar gurus' scrutiny. Sometimes the stream of consciousness may seem scatterbrained and unfocused, but this was not done adventitiously. Each word was diligently and rigorously labored over. The steadfast and unwavering pace of self deprecating and self disparaging levity reminds the reader that the mission of the book is to be jocular and jovial at its own faults, follies, and foibles. Debuting author, Brandon C. Jones, hits the scene with his complete collection of work. Each chapter is autonomous and non-interdependent on the others. It's the kind of treatise that can be read in several different settings without losing momentum. Tone, word choice and style fluctuate, but motifs of a throwback to archetypal Woody Allen's erudite absurdity act as the midwife to the birth of a refreshing style of American literature. Mr.J is currently working on 3 new novels, a joke-a-day calendar, submissions for media, and is featured in USA TODAY reporting his nomination for the coveted ""BEST BREAKTHROUGH AUTHOR 2011 AWARD"" presented by the reviewers and staff of UK's underground publishing house, Indie-Press, INC."	68	April 26th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11801307-meet-mr-j

The Wilderness Family: At Home with Africa's Wildlife		Kobie Krüger	4.46	1129	81	{5: '696', 4: '293', 3: '109', 2: '22', 1: '9'}	"Everyone warned Kobie Krüger that being the wife of a game warden at a remote ranger station in South Africa's largest national park would be an arduous move. The heat was unbearable, malaria would be a constant danger, her husband would have to be away for long stretches, there were no schools or nearby doctors for their three daughters, and of course the area teemed with wild animals. Yet for Kobie and her family, the seventeen years at South Africa's Kruger National Park were the most magical of their lives. Now, in The Wilderness Family, Kobie recounts the enchanting adventures and extraordinary encounters they experienced in this vast reserve where wildlife has right of way.Kobie and her husband Kobus were overwhelmed by the beauty of the Mahlangeni ranger station when they arrived with their little girls in the autumn of 1980. Golden sunshine glowed in the lush garden where fruit bats hung in the sausage trees; hippos basked in the glittering waters of the Letaba River; storks and herons perched along the shore. Kobie felt she had found heaven on earth--until she awoke that first night to find a python slithering silently across her bedroom floor. It was the perfect introduction to the wonders and terrors that awaited her.As the Krügers settled in, they became accustomed to living in the midst of ravishing splendor and daily surprises. A honey badger they nursed back to health rampaged affectionately through the house. Sneaky hyenas stole blankets and cook pots. Ordinarily placid elephants grew foul-tempered and violent in the summer heat. And one terrible day, the shadow of tragedy fell across the family when a lion attacked Kobus in the bush and nearly killed him.But nothing prepared the Krügers for the adventure of raising an orphaned lion cub. The cub was only a few days old and on the verge of death when they found him alone.  Leo, as the girls promptly named the cub, survived on loads of love and bottles of fat-enriched milk, and soon became an affectionate, rambunctious member of the family. At the heart of the book, Kobie recounts the unique bond that each of the Krügers forged with Leo and their sometimes hilarious endeavor to teach him to become a ""real"" lion and live with his own kind in the wild.Writing with deep affection and luminous prose, Kobie Krüger captures here the mystery of untamed Africa--its fathomless skies, soulful landscapes, and most of all, its astonishing array of animals. By turns funny and heart-breaking, engaging and suspenseful, The Wilderness Family is an unforgettable memoir of a woman, her family, and the amazing game reserve they called home for seventeen incredible years."	400	May 1st 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/830265.The_Wilderness_Family

Soldier, Lily, Peace and Pearls		Con Cú	4.65	17	11	{5: '11', 4: '6', 3: '0', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	Short Synopsis of Soldier, Lily, Peace and PearlsThe novel begins in 1994 with the decision of Dr. Han Thieu, who is terminally ill with cancer, to secretly take her own life. She does this in the belief that it will spare her family the impact of her drawn-out death. The chapter alludes to the main characters in the novel and to the traumas that her family has already undergone. Her daughter Minh Chau is one of the three protagonists in the novel.The novel then goes back to April 1975 when the communist forces in Cambodia and South Vietnam take power. The lives of the eight-year-old Vietnamese-Chinese boy, Quan Phoc, in Phnom Penh and of Han Thieu’s two-year-old daughter Minh Chau in Saigon change radically when the two cities fall to the Communists. The Khmer Rouge send Quan’s family to a collective farm in the distant countryside. Quan’s father is worked and starved to death and his mother is brutally raped to death. Quan and his sister, Hue, survive the farm thanks to Quan’s ability to endear himself to the Khmer Rouge guards. Minh Chau’s family attempts unsuccessfully to flee Saigon. Her father, a South Vietnamese army officer is sent to a re-education camp and the rest of the family is imprisoned. Quan and sister are liberated from the farm when the Vietnamese army invades Cambodia in 1978. Traveling down the Mekong River, they try to escape Indochina by sea. Near death, they are rescued by a boat of Vietnamese refugees heading to Malaysia.After Dr. Han Thieu saves the life of a senior Communist official, the Thieu family are also given a chance to escape by sea. During the voyage, five-year-old Minh Chau is faced with the moral dilemma of saving her sister, An, from death, at the expense of the life of a neighbour and friend. This leaves her emotionally scarred. In Pulau Bidong camp in Malaysia, the Thieu family adopts Quan and Hue, and Quan is assigned the role to protect the girls in the family. When Quan is forced to kill Dahan, a drunken Malaysian camp guard, in order to save Minh Chau and his sister Hue, his chances for re-settlement in Canada with the Thieu family are dashed. The Thieu family go to Quebec City with the hope that the Canadian authorities will later accept Quan despite the killing of the guard. The Pulau Bidong chapters are marked by touching anecdotes of interaction between the camp’s children, the mystery of Chinese traditional medicine and swift action scenes as Quan defends the young girls from Dahan.In Canada, Mathieu Hibou, a soft-spoken university student from New Carlisle, Quebec is asked by his cousin, Marie-Christine, who was a friend of Han Thieu in Saigon, to help the Thieu family integrate into Canadian society. Mathieu devotes himself to the family and helps Han re-certify as a doctor in Canada. The Quebec chapters are a combination of humourous anecdotes about the discovery by Minh Chau and An of their new country. It is also a touching exposé about the hardships and success of Boat People in Canada. Denied entry to Canada, Quan and his sister escape to Bangkok where to survive, Quan becomes part of a Chinese Triad, smuggling drugs into Europe. When the Triad sends Quan five years later to Canada on a mission to check out the possibility of smuggling heroin into the USA via Canada, he is discovered in Montreal by Minh Chau and her father, Voang. Voang convinces Quan to abandon his life of crime and re-join the family in Quebec City. The Triad is outraged when Quan suddenly disappears and relentlessly attempts to find him. For one year, Quan escapes discovery by the Triad, but eventually he is forced to flee Quebec to protect the Thieu family. This breaks Minh Chau’s heart, who then as a young adolescent rebels against her family whom she feels did not protect Quan.In the meantime, Mathieu Hibou has fallen in love with a beautiful Rwandan student, Denise Hazikimana. They marry in New Carlisle, his hometown in the Gaspé Peninisula, with the blessing of his “adopted” Vietnamese family. Minh Chau, one of the flower girls, offers the couple a very symbolic gift. The couple moves then to Denise’s native Rwanda where Mathieu works in agricultural development and Denise becomes a noted TV commentator. In 1994, Mathieu, on a trip to Montreal, arrives just after Han Thieu has committed suicide. Then political chaos strikes Rwanda where Denise, a Tutsi, and their son Étienne have remained behind. Mathieu returns to Kigali to discover that his wife and son have vanished, and Hutu extremists are systematically exterminating Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The death of Han Thieu sends her daughter, Minh Chau, into a deep depression. Her father, Voang, decides that only Quan can bring his daughter out of this depression. He finds Quan, hiding out in British Columbia, and convinces him to return to Montreal to save Minh Chau. When Quan returns, Minh Chau, now 22, throws herself at him and becomes his lover.Mathieu, devastated by the murder of his family, leaves Africa to work for UNDP in the Gaza Strip.

Bloodstains		Jeff Mudgett	3.46	404	58	{5: '104', 4: '104', 3: '109', 2: '48', 1: '39'}	For decades English investigators have been convinced that one, or two, or the Jack Ripper murders were committed by an American surgeon in London. Maybe they were right. The story of the author's great-great grandfather, Herman Webster Mudgett. History knows him as the infamous serial killer, H. H. Holmes.Bloodstains is the startling tale of one man’s search for the truth after inheriting the personal diaries belonging to his great-great-grandfather who he discovers was America’s first and most notorious serial killer Herman Webster Mudgett. Better known by his alias H.H. Holmes, Mudgett was the mass murderer who struck terror into the nation by being the proprietor of the infamous Murder Castle and stalking the streets of Chicago during the 1893 World’s Fair. During his incarceration awaiting execution, well over a century ago, Holmes admitted killing 27 innocent victims, but the evidence the author locates indicates hundreds more likely. From his investigation, Jeff Mudgett, the direct descendant, learns that Holmes’ reign of terror was worldwide and not limited to Chicago as has been so widely believed. Based upon never before revealed historical facts, Jeff pieces together a dynamic and extraordinary puzzle, including the strong possibility that Holmes was also Jack the Ripper.Far more than a documentary, Bloodstains is precariously balanced on the very edge between non-fiction and the paranormal, as the author’s research of his evil ancestor quickly takes on a personal aspect. Jeff soon fears his efforts may have awakened the legendary ‘Holmes Curse’ of the 1890s, the one investigated and written about by most of the nation’s major publications, including The New York Times. In fact, the deeper he digs into Holmes’ devilish past, the stronger the monster’s hold on him seems to become, testing the limits of his own sanity, as well as humanity. Racked by a mysterious and never before experienced epilepsy, Jeff suffers crippling grand mal seizures whenever he disobeys the haunting voices in his head. Finally, with nowhere else to turn, Jeff is forced to make the decisions of his genetic lifetime in a life-or-death struggle in order to win the greatest prize of all: his survival.

The first child of a heartless father and a discarded mother is left to fend for himself on the streets of Mashhad, seeking food and shelter wherever he can. His lonely early years are an unbelievable tale of cruelty and betrayal on the part of nearly everyone who might be expected to help, save for one aunt who does her best to keep him from starving.But living a harsh and solitary existence has one advantage for this little boy: other than forcing him to be self-reliant, no one attempts to indoctrinate him on rural Iranian society's archaic cultural values and religious beliefs. And so he never accepts his wretched state as fate, choosing instead to dream big dreams about getting an education, having his own family, and starting a new life – possibly in the faraway land called America. He makes a plan and by the age of 17 he boards a plane to the land of possibilities, where his dreams eventually also take flight.	297	2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11244026-solacers

Assuring IT Governance (Assurance Services, #2)		Robert E.  Davis	4.80	5	2	{5: '4', 4: '1', 3: '0', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	Depending on the abstraction level, IT governance can be viewed as a framework, methodology, or technique. As a framework, IT governance enables a “system of controls” assisting in assuring organizational goals and objectives are achieved effectively and efficiently. As a methodology, IT governance furnishes a description of the role entity direction and controls play in achieving information systems objectives. Lastly, as a technique, IT governance provides processes and steps that can generate superior financial and/or reputational returns for stakeholders.Whatever your perspective may be, the importance of effective and efficient IT governance cannot be overlooked in the current global high technology environment. Considering what is at stake politically, economically and technically for most organizations; usually justifying IT governance deployment based on one viewpoint narrows suitability and expected benefits. In the final analysis, combining the potential individual abstraction levels may be the most appropriate support for implementing IT governance.“Assuring IT Governance” was written with the intent to create quality quick reference material for assurance service practitioners. Therefore, this pocket guide is appropriate for entity employees interested in ensuring, or verifying, the design and deployment of IT Governance.

But his luck seems to change when he meets a young beautiful woman, Laura, who, he discovers, shares a horrifying experience from his own past. He barely gets to enjoy his newfound luck, however, before it abruptly changes—and this time for the worse. Laura turns up missing, and Stephen must face the ghost who haunted him in his childhood if he has any hope of saving Laura. And he soon discovers, in order to save her, he must find the missing body of a woman murdered five years ago—before her killer does.	325				https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11214564-the-haunting-of-stephen-wells

Gunung Makrifat : Memoar Para Pencari Tuhan		Tri Wibowo	3.56	9	3	{5: '4', 4: '1', 3: '1', 2: '2', 1: '1'}	Novel ini lahir dari pengembaraan dan pengalaman di jalan tarekat sufi; dari perenungan dan dialog batin yang tak usai-usai–berkesudahan. Kisah dalam novel sufistik ini sederhana, namun penuh dengan perbincangan tentang hidup dan Tuhan, tentang keruhanian, perjalanan intelektual, dan pergolakan batin; juga dialog mengenai ajaran kesufian dari para syekh sufi agung seperti Muhyiddin Ibn ‘Arabi, Maulana Rumi, Syekh Manshur al-Hallaj, dan Syekh Fariduddin Atthar; serta tentang misteri mistis yang hadir dalam setiap perjalanan ruhani.Plotnya memang dibuat sederhana, agar pembaca lebih fokus pada muatan pemikiran dan lanskap batin, pada ‘rasa’ ruhani (zawq), yang tak kasat mata. Sang pendaki gunung, tokoh dalam novel ini, tak sekadar berkisah, namun ia mengajak pembacanya untuk melihat sisi lain dari duka dan kepedihan–tepatnya, sisi yang indah dari kesedihan di jalan spiritual, yang akan mengantarkan sang salik pada cinta dan pencerahan. Dalam pengembaraan dan perenungannya yang panjang dan menyakitkan, sang pendaki gunung pada akhirnya menyadari sebagian dari makna tersembunyi di balik ajaran tasawuf yang tampak anggun sekaligus samar dan gaib. Namun perjalanan di jalan Tuhan adalah pengembaraan tak berujung, dan kesadaran inilah yang membuat sang pendaki gunung memahami salah satu misteri terdalam dari tauhid.					https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8490969-gunung-makrifat

Remembering Tomorrow		Jeffrey Pierce	3.94	52	7	{5: '20', 4: '16', 3: '10', 2: '5', 1: '1'}	"In a final stand of old growth timber, a stranger is found shivering in a patch of new snow on a hot summer day. The world has changed from the one he knew; society has stumbled and the rural areas have lost their connection to the rest of the country. Over the last sixty years, a culture has grown amidst the myths of the world before, developing its own beliefs around the ever present cycles of nature. Those who live within the shadows of the ancient trees have never seen a television or an electric light, they have never watched a plane climb into the sky or listened to voices echoing from a radio. The nightmare Alexander escaped from, that left him shivering with fear in a blanket of summer snow, is not ready to let him go. The echoes of another world slip into the mortal realm in the jealousy of an immortal lover who seeks to possess the one man who has ever told her, ""No."" He has always held out for the love he once knew, the woman whose memory gave him strength through the years spent in the realm of the fae, never submitting to the immortal Nakayla's icy embrace. And now he has escaped to find Megan, the woman he loves, living in another lifetime, surrounded by a world he doesn't know. Within the pages of Remembering Tomorrow we discover that the myths of our past are intimately tied to the environment of the present. We find that hatred and rage are powers that can rival those of love and sacrifice. As the story builds to a tension-filled climax, lives are lost, the bonds of magic are severed, and we discover that sometimes losing the battle is the only way to win the war."	208	November 5th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13074597-remembering-tomorrow

It's a phrase to say to ourselves (and sometimes others) when we are acting or thinking in a way that is hindering our ability to succeed. It doesn't necessarily mean 'get over it' or 'pull yourself together' (although there may be occasions when both responses are necessary). 'Shut Up' means stop what you're doing, take time out to reflect, let go of baggage and beliefs that hinder your potential. 'Move On' means tomorrow can be different from today, look for new possibilities, don't just think about it, take action. There are six S.U.M.O. principles that are designed to help you create and enjoy a brilliant life. If you are wrestling with life's challenges, these principles will help you do so more successfully.1. Change Your T-Shirt - take responsibility for your own life and don't be a victim. 2. Develop Fruity Thinking - change your thinking and change your results. 3. Hippo Time is OK - understand how setbacks affect you and how to recover from them. 4. Remember the Beachball - increase your understanding and awareness of other people's world. 5. Learn Latin - change comes through action not intention. Overcome the tendency to put things off. 6. Ditch Doris Day - create your own future rather than leave it to chance. Forget the attitude 'que sera, sera, whatever will be, will be.'""A superb book. It combines honesty, humour and inspiration to help people move ahead in life."" --Allan and Barbara Pease, authors of Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps""Powerful, simple and effective.

Burned Alive		Souad	3.98	9952	738	{5: '3699', 4: '3365', 3: '2118', 2: '562', 1: '208'}	When Souad was seventeen she fell in love. In her village, as in so many others, sex before marriage was considered a grave dishonour to one's family and was punishable by death. This was her crime. Her brother-in-law was given the task of arranging her punishment. One morning while Souad was washing the family's clothes, he crept up on her, poured petrol over her and set her alight.In the eyes of their community he was a hero. An execution for a 'crime of honour' was a respectable duty unlikely to bring about condemnation from others. It certainly would not have provoked calls for his prosecution. More than five thousand cases of such honour killings are reported around the world each year and many more take place that we hear nothing about.Miraculously, Souad survived rescued by the women of her village, who put out the flames and took her to a local hospital. Horrifically burned, and abandoned by her family and community, it was only the intervention of a European aid worker that enabled Souad to receive the care and sanctuary she so desperately needed and to start her life again. She has now decided to tell her story and uncover the barbarity of honour killings, a practice which continues to this day.Burned Alive is a shocking testimony, a true story of almost unbelievable cruelty. It speaks of amazing courage and fortitude and of one woman's determination to survive. It is also a call to break the taboo of silence that surrounds this most brutal of practices and which ignores the plight of so many other women who are also victims of traditional violence.	359	2005	['Souad, Ayah, Ibu, Kainat, Noura, Assad, Hussein, Faiez, Marwan, Jacqueline, Hassan, Edmond Kaiser, Antonio, Laetitia, Nadia']		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386990.Burned_Alive

Race Decoded: The Genomic Fight for Social Justice		Catherine Bliss	4.25	16	2	{5: '8', 4: '6', 3: '0', 2: '2', 1: '0'}	In 2000, with the success of the Human Genome Project, scientists declared the death of race in biology and medicine. But within five years, many of these same scientists had reversed course and embarked upon a new hunt for the biological meaning of race. Drawing on personal interviews and life stories, Race Decoded takes us into the world of elite genome scientists—including Francis Collins, director of the NIH; Craig Venter, the first person to create a synthetic genome; and Spencer Wells, National Geographic Society explorer-in-residence, among others—to show how and why they are formulating new ways of thinking about race.In this original exploration, Catherine Bliss reveals a paradigm shift, both at the level of science and society, from colorblindness to racial consciousness. Scientists have been fighting older understandings of race in biology while simultaneously promoting a new grand-scale program of minority inclusion. In selecting research topics or considering research design, scientists routinely draw upon personal experience of race to push the public to think about race as a biosocial entity, and even those of the most privileged racial and social backgrounds incorporate identity politics in the scientific process. Though individual scientists may view their positions differently—whether as a black civil rights activist or a white bench scientist—all stakeholders in the scientific debates are drawing on memories of racial discrimination to fashion a science-based activism to fight for social justice.	280	May 23rd 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13125954-race-decoded

How to Argue like Jesus: Learning Persuasion from History's Greatest Communicator		['Joe  Carter', 'John  Coleman']	3.48	102	14	{5: '13', 4: '40', 3: '33', 2: '15', 1: '1'}	Uses Jesus' words and actions found in the New Testament to systematically evaluate his rhetorical stylings, drawing real lessons from his teachings that today's readers can employ. Jesus of Nazareth never wrote a book, held political office, or wielded a sword. He never gained sway with the mighty or influential. He never took up arms against the governing powers in Rome. He was a lower-class worker who died an excruciating death at the age of thirty-three. Yet, in spite of all odds-obscurity, powerlessness, and execution-his words revolutionized human history. How to Argue like Jesus examines the life and words of Jesus and describes the various ways in which he sought-through the spoken word, his life, and his disciples-to reach others with his message. The authors then pull some very simple rhetorical lessons from Jesus' life that readers can use today. Both Christian and non-Christian leaders in just about any field can improve their ability to communicate effectively by studying the words and methods of history's greatest communicator.	174				https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5954432-how-to-argue-like-jesus

Billy Oliver: Holding On To Memories		Charles Peters	5.00	3	1		"Billy Oliver by Charles Peters is universally appealing; this truly inspirational book was written for readers who enjoy reminiscing about the good old days, or wonder what life was like without cell phones, computers, and television. Whatever their age, it's guaranteed readers will become so engrossed in this heartfelt story, they will find it impossible to put this book down until they reach the very last page. The story takes place in the late 1940s in northwest Iowa, and reveals how a youngster's life is transformed when he finally leaves his meager existence behind to live at a new place that promises the opportunity of a bright future. When his mother becomes terminally ill, Billy, one of thirteen children, picks wild flowers every day to cheer her up. ""Remember telling me how they tell a story?"" he asks her. ""Mama, look at them. The stems are straight and strong, just like you said we are to live our lives. See how green and lush the leaves are, representing life's experiences? See all the beautiful blossoms representing love?"" After placing a white rosebud on her chest, he reminds her that she told him that thorns tell us to protect ourselves, and that unopened white buds symbolize purity and innocence, and bring the promise of a new day. When his mother dies, Billy is only nine years old, and he wonders what will happen next. Where will he sleep and eat? Will Papa abandon him now, too? When he and his siblings are sent to stay with their Aunt Sarah and Uncle Jacob, he wonders if he will ever see all the neat things he had found and stored in the barn again, or his thousand-piece horse puzzle. Three weeks later, Billy's grandma instructs the children to write their names on pieces of paper and put them into a hat, and this is how she, their father, Aunt Sarah, and Billy's eldest brother Lee decide where each of them will live. Billy subsequently moves to his grandparents' house, where he plays cards every night, listens to The Great Gildersleeve on the radio, and learns how to crochet, earn money parking cars, can vegetables, and make tomato juice. Tragically, some time after Uncle Jacob is hit by a train and killed, Grandma suffers from a brain aneurism, and Grandpa is unable to take care of both her and Billy. When Billy's father arranges for his son to be taken a hundred miles away to a home for boys and girls, ""Maybe you will get adopted,"" he says. From then on, how Billy handles repeated rejection and encourages other children at the orphanage to stay positive is outstanding, and something that is sure to touch every reader's heart. The day he is chosen for adoption at eleven years old, ""I am thrilled,"" he says. ""I can feel my heart pounding in my chest like no other time before, I was very excited."" When it's finally time for Billy to leave his colorful past behind, ""Thank you, Mama,"" he whispers, ""for teaching me good values to live by."" At last, he has a new Mom and Dad, and is about to start a new life on a farm. Written in memory of his biological mother, ""an amazing woman,"" the author says Billy's childhood experiences were inspired by many of his own. Without doubt, the feelings and emotion expressed in this book could only come from a person who has lived the story. With its happy ending, Billy Oliver is definitely a book readers will want to keep and treasure forever."	190	September 27th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12827152-billy-oliver
The Popularity Papers	The Popularity Papers #1	Amy Ignatow	4.09	7961	440	{5: '3979', 4: '1819', 3: '1387', 2: '447', 1: '329'}	"Lydia Goldblatt and Julie Graham-Chang are best friends with one goal: to crack the code of popularity. Lydia’s the bold one: aspiring theater star, stick-fighting enthusiast, human guinea pig. Julie’s the shy one: observer and artist, accidental field hockey star, faithful recorder. In this notebook they write down their observations and carry out experiments to try to determine what makes the popular girls tick. But somehow, when Lydia and Julie try to imitate the popular girls, their efforts don’t translate into instant popularity. Lydia ends up with a bald spot, their parents won’t stop yelling, and Julie finds herself the number-one crush of Roland Asbjørnsen. Worse, they seem to be drifting farther and farther from their goal—and each other.Amy Ignatow’s hilarious debut novel introduces the intrepid fifth-graders Julie and Lydia, whose quest to understand popularity may not succeed in the ways they want, but will succeed in keeping readers in stitches.
From Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books:
Lydia and Julie, BFFs since birth, are now preparing to enter junior high, and they're on a mission to become popular. First, however, they have to determine exactly how popularity is achieved, so they decide to approach the matter as any good scientist would: observe those creatures already at the height of popularity and apply said observations to themselves, in the hopes of cracking into that mysterious world of junior-high stardom. The two record their observations and the often spectacularly unsuccessful outcomes of their various social experiments in a scrapbook-like journal, complete with notes passed at school, lists of projected popularity goals, and credibly goofy and kidlike drawings. The story here is fairly familiar: the girls fail miserably at their first attempts at the A-list (Lydia's hair falls out after a botched dye job, among other disasters) but eventually find acceptance in the upper echelon, only to learn the valuable lesson that it's the people you're most comfortable around who make the best friends. The diary format, however, adds an extra dimension of funny, and as in Jeff Kinney's Wimpy Kid series about Greg Heffley, it allows Julie and Lydia to come alive through their witty dialogue, their perceptive commentary, and even their characteristic handwriting. Secondary characters shine as well, particularly Julie's embarrassing but ultimately charming two dads, along with Lydia's goth-punk sister, a font of random quips and junior high wisdom. The popular kids end up being far from perfect and each has issues of her own to contend with, making the actual friendships that form among the girls all the more endearing. Those waiting for the next installment of Greg Heffley's adventures will be well served by this amusing experiment in sixth-grade celebrity.

The Best of Both Worlds of Essie: Island Style Novel	Essie Brown	['Luke A.M. Brown', 'Berthalicia Fonseca-Brown']	5.00	2	1		Mrs. Essie Brown was having the time of her life. She was now an honorable matriculated New York resident in New York City, the ultimate big city. However, she never forgets her striving family, which was now dispersed all over the globe. This story concentrates exclusively on Essie's (the main character from The Non-Silence of the LAMB) adulthood years. Unlike The Non-Silence of the LAMB, it doesn't show the relationships with her children's fathers. What it does show is how her children grew up to be responsible business owners and striving members of their society. Essie enjoys visiting them regularly as they were settled all around the world. However, their lives were not all hunky dory. Each child's life carries its own drama and nail-biting events that thrust Essie in the midst of them all. Many of these involved immigration issues and the parity of right and wrong in various sibling rivalries. Essie is forced to take sides and face the consequences of the other's wrath.	180	January 30th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10960414-the-best-of-both-worlds-of-essie

Pages: 22. Not illustrated. Free updates online. Purchase includes a free trial membership in the publisher's book club where you can select from more than a million books without charge. Excerpt: The Giver is a 1993 soft science fiction novel by Lois Lowry. It is set in a future society which is at first presented as a utopian society and gradually appears more and more dystopian; therefore, it could be considered anti-utopian. The novel follows a boy named Jonas through the twelfth year of his life. The society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to ""Sameness,"" a plan which has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the position of ""Receiver of Memory,"" the person who stores all the memories of the time before Sameness, in case they are ever needed to aid in decisions that others lack the experience to make. When Jonas meets the Giver, he is confused in many ways. The Giver is also able to break some rules, such as turning off the speaker and locking his door. As Jonas receives the memories from the previous receiverthe ""Giver""he discovers the power of knowledge. The people in his community are happy because they don't know of a better life but with the knowledge of what they are missing out on it could create chaos. He faces a dilemma: Should he stay with the community, his family living a shallow life without love, color, sound and knowledge or should he run away to where he can live a full life? Despite controversy and criticism that the book's subject material is inappropriate for young children, The Giver won the 1994 Newbery Medal and has sold more than 5.3 million copies. In Australia, the United States and Canada, it is a part of many middle school reading lists, but it is also on many banned book lists and appeared on the American Library Association's list of the most challenged books of the 1990's....More: http: //booksllc.net/?id=19993"	24	June 21st 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8707741-lois-lowry-giver-series

Op die zomerse zeventiende juni in 1969 staat iedereen voor het polderhuis om de koningin feestelijk te begroeten. De Kaantjes, de zoons van boerderij Kaan, wapperen enthousiast met hun vlaggetjes. Als hun moeder met de kleine Hanne te laat op het feestterrein aankomt, precies op het moment dat de koningin in de auto stapt, streelt Juliana het meisje over haar wang en geeft Anna Kaan koninklijk de hand. Het zou een onvergetelijke feestdag geworden zijn, als de bakker 's middags tijdens een inhaalbezorgronde niet met zijn splinternieuwe VW-busje de in de berm spelende Hanne had geraakt. Als Jan Kaan vele jaren later op een gloeiendhete junidag van Texel komt om de grafsteen van zijn zusje op te knappen, is er meteen weer spanning en stille woede.

Edward III	The English Monarchs	W. Mark Ormrod	4.26	90	11	{5: '42', 4: '33', 3: '12', 2: '2', 1: '1'}	Edward III (1312–1377) was the most successful European ruler of his age. Reigning for over fifty years, he achieved spectacular military triumphs and overcame grave threats to his authority, from parliamentary revolt to the Black Death. Revered by his subjects as a chivalric dynamo, he initiated the Hundred Years' War and gloriously led his men into battle against the Scots and the French.In this illuminating biography, W. Mark Ormrod takes a deeper look at Edward to reveal the man beneath the military muscle. What emerges is Edward's clear sense of his duty to rebuild the prestige of the Crown, and through military gains and shifting diplomacy, to secure a legacy for posterity. New details of the splendor of Edward's court, lavish national celebrations, and innovative use of imagery establish the king's instinctive understanding of the bond between ruler and people. With fresh emphasis on how Edward's rule was affected by his family relationships—including his roles as traumatized son, loving husband, and dutiful father—Ormrod gives a valuable new dimension to our understanding of this remarkable warrior king.	720	January 24th 2012	['Edward III of England']		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11461997-edward-iii

That is, until the doorbell rings. Standing on her front step is a young man who looks so much like Max; same smile, same eyes, same age, same adorable bump in his nose; he could be Max's long-lost relation. He introduces himself as Paolo, an Italian editor of American coffee table books, and shows Shelley some childhood photos. Paolo tells her that the man in the photos, the bearded man who Paolo says is his grandfather though he never seems to age, is Max. Her Max. And he is alive and well.As outrageous as Paolo's claims seem; how could her husband be alive? And if he is, why hasn't he looked her up? Shelley desperately wants to know the truth. She and Paolo jet across the globe to track Max down; if it is really Max and along the way, Shelley recounts the European package tour where they had met. As she relives Max's stories of bloody Parisian barricades, medieval Austrian kitchens, and buried Roman boathouses, Shelley begins to piece together the story of who her husband was and what these new revelations mean for her ""happily ever after."" And as she and Paolo get closer to the truth, Shelley discovers that not all stories end where they are supposed to."	297	August 2nd 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10230881-before-ever-after

But was he right? Can the quantum theory of fields and Einstein's general theory of relativity, the two most accurate and successful theories in all of physics, be united in a single quantum theory of gravity? Can quantum and cosmos ever be combined? On this issue, two of the world's most famous physicists--Stephen Hawking (""A Brief History of Time"") and Roger Penrose (""The Emperor's New Mind"" and ""Shadows of the Mind"")--disagree. Here they explain their positions in a work based on six lectures with a final debate, all originally presented at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge.How could quantum gravity, a theory that could explain the earlier moments of the big bang and the physics of the enigmatic objects known as black holes, be constructed? Why does our patch of the universe look just as Einstein predicted, with no hint of quantum effects in sight? What strange quantum processes can cause black holes to evaporate, and what happens to all the information that they swallow? Why does time go forward, not backward?In this book, the two opponents touch on all these questions. Penrose, like Einstein, refuses to believe that quantum mechanics is a final theory. Hawking thinks otherwise, and argues that general relativity simply cannot account for how the universe began. Only a quantum theory of gravity, coupled with the no-boundary hypothesis, can ever hope to explain adequately what little we can observe about our universe. Penrose, playing the realist to Hawking's positivist, thinks that the universe is unbounded and will expand forever. The universe can be understood, he argues, in terms of the geometry of light cones, the compression and distortion of spacetime, and by the use of twistor theory. With the final debate, the reader will come to realize how much Hawking and Penrose diverge in their opinions of the ultimate quest to combine quantum mechanics and relativity, and how differently they have tried to comprehend the incomprehensible."	152	October 8th 2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2103.The_Nature_of_Space_and_Time
Isabella Moon		Laura Benedict	3.14	526	126	{5: '63', 4: '136', 3: '183', 2: '101', 1: '43'}	“Isabella Moon is a book of secrets and dark miracles. Laura Benedict writes with tender power and understanding, filling the pages with characters whose mysteries and longings will matter to every reader.”–Luanne Rice, author of The Edge of Winter Sometimes the past comes looking for you. . . .Two years ago, in idyllic Carystown, Kentucky, nine-year-old Isabella Moon disappeared on her way home from school. Is it just coincidence that Kate Russell, a young woman with no discernible past, arrived in town just months before Isabella’s disappearance? When Kate walks into Sheriff Bill Delaney’s office to tell him that Isabella’s ghost has led her to the child’s hidden grave, he immediately views her as a suspect. Mystery follows mystery as a local athlete drops dead, inexplicably, on the basketball court, and someone close to Kate is viciously murdered.Quiet Carystown was to be Kate’s salvation, and she’s settled into a comfortable job, a charming cottage, and a blissful romance. But having lied to her boyfriend, Caleb, for so long about the terrors of her past life, she finds she can’t trust him to understand the terror that Isabella Moon has now brought. And Kate’s best friend, Francie, is too wrapped up in her own troubles–particularly a secret affair with a man she at once loves and despises–to give Kate the help she needs. Utterly alone, Kate is torn between finding justice for the dead child and keeping away old ghosts of her own.The unsolved disappearance of Isabella Moon has been the biggest disappointment of Sheriff Delaney’s career. But he senses that Kate is trouble. As he investigates her impossible claims, he also uncovers a series of unsettling truths about Carystown itself. Behind his hometown’s genteel façade is a morass of lies and murder, drugs and destruction. And Carystown’s residents are about to discover that even though the past is buried, it can rise again–with a vengeance.Dark and suspenseful, tense and eerie, tinged with the supernatural, Isabella Moon is an engrossing, beautifully written debut novel, a breathtaking and artful story of the dark mysteries that can lurk in the most bucolic of places–and the ghost of a little girl who watches as evil rises unstoppably to the surface.	368	September 25th 2007		['Carystown, Kentucky', 'Kentucky']	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1097633.Isabella_Moon

Hired to be the new marshal, he is confronted with the suspicion and anxiety of a once peaceful, small town with a growing mining problem (or perhaps it is a mining town with a small growing problem). Whatever the case, O'Malley swiftly learns that the invisible foes that stalk him in his sleep are nothing compared to the passionately pious force that is the Ladies Church Society and the beautiful but feisty Amanda Morgan, a woman who finds O'Malley's lack of religion as disturbing as he finds her attractive. Their tangles over faith and propriety peak with the arrival of a sultry and scandalous songstress from O'Malley's past, a wave of criminal accusations from the town newspaper and a flood of questions from suspicious citizens about the mysterious stranger O'Malley is giving sanctuary in the town jail. With troubling questions being raised regarding O'Malley's personal history, the one thing even the most patient of townspeople are growing certain of is that the new marshal isn't likely to see the New Year in Kanen.	502	2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13399973-the-peacemaker

Henry and Anne are bona fide soul mates, bound to each other through eternity.Still, in 1536, they are at the mercy of influences outside of their control, explosively incompatible, and caught in a marriage that ends in a betrayal so shocking that Anne requires lifetimes to recover.""Threads"", a reincarnation fantasy, opens with Anne's death in 1536. Her husband Henry, seemingly in defense of Anne (but more likely acting out of ""stubborn perverseness,"" she observes), has terrorized England and decreed murder after political murder to protect her. Ultimately, to Anne's horror, he has made the decision to have her executed as well.Anne's fury at her husband's betrayal has enough momentum to survive centuries, but in ""Threads"" she learns that she has been assigned a hard task: she must forgive him. This may prove difficult and take some. The husband in question is Henry VIII. The narrator is the stubborn, volatile Anne Boleyn, who is not at all inclined to forgive.It is a very unusual love story.2000 William Faulkner Competition finalist for best novel."	355	February 1st 2002	['Anne Boleyn', 'Henry VIII of England']		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16003938-threads

When he purchased four acres of land on Vashon Island, he was looking for an affordable home a ferry ride away from the restaurants he ran in Seattle. But as he continued to serve his customers frozen chicken breasts and packaged pork, he became aware of the connection between what he ate and where it came from: a hive of bees provided honey; a young cow could give fresh milk; an apple orchard allowed him to make vinegar. Told in Timmermeister's plainspoken voice, Growing a Farmer details with honesty the initial stumbles and subsequent realities he had to face in his quest to establish a profitable farm for himself. Personal yet practical, Growing a Farmer includes the specifics of making cheese, raising cows, and slaughtering pigs, and it will recast entirely the way we think about our relationship to the food we consume.	335	January 17th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8144675-growing-a-farmer

Dead-on accurate in its depiction of rituals both harming and healing, and respectful of spiritual tradition and historical fact, this book stands alongside Kathleen Kent's The ""Heretic's Daughter"" as a must-read for anyone fascinated by Salem's past.""-Maura D. Shaw, coauthor of ""Celebrating the Great Mother"" and ""Tarot Games"" Thriller, spiritual mystery, historical fiction ... or truth revealed? Twenty-first-century Salem still guarded the secrets of lies and violence, torture and blackmail-even premeditated murder-that took place during the Witch Trials of 1692. Behind the gaudy museums and shops, the crowded bus tours of local haunts, the seemingly upright Colonial families dating back to the settling of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, festered a conspiracy of longstanding guilt and purely human greed. Only one woman knew of the Family Confederacy-Sophie St. Cloud, whose connection to the Salem Witch Trials is part magickal, part personal. Sophie's dreams and hauntings have told her that the time has come to end the threat of the Confederacy and free the murdered souls of Salem after 315 years. With the aid of three friends, also mysteriously connected to Salem's past tragedies, she sets out on a perilous, exacting pilgrimage of Emancipation. The name of Giles Corey is familiar to anyone who knows the terrible story of the persecution and trials of those unfortunates who were accused of witchcraft in Essex County in 1692. Refusing to admit guilt, the elderly farmer was pressed under heavy stones and then beaten to death. His wife Martha hung soon thereafter, in the last group of executions before the trials were stopped. Every September, a secret ritual was performed by members of the conspiracy to keep Giles restrained in this world, unable to move to the next. Sophie St. Cloud must use all her spiritual and shamanic powers to defeat the evil and bring the good to Light in Salem's most historical graveyards. Michael Sortomme, writer and artist, embarked on a spiritual career that spanned more than three decades and encompassed metaphysics, the occult arts, and active indigenous Shamanic practice. Educated in archeology and modern literature, she has journeyed in pursuit of Truth that she translates into vivid paintings and equally compelling stories. Currently on hiatus from private practice and community service, Michael is focusing on her life as an author and multi-media artist. She lives and creates under a 150-year-old Larch tree in Oregon's Pinot noir country. Her passions include herstory, genetic genealogy, international travel, and fine dark chocolate.

I expected to love the children who hung on my legs after Sunday morning services until they grew up and had children of their own. I even expected to be buried wearing the same red vestments in which I was ordained.Today those vestments are hanging in the sacristy of an Anglican church in Kenya, my church pension is frozen, and I am as likely to spend Sunday mornings with friendly Quakers, Presbyterians, or Congregationalists as I am with the Episcopalians who remain my closest kin. Some-times I even keep the Sabbath with a cup of steaming Assam tea on my front porch, watching towhees vie for the highest perch in the poplar tree while God watches me. These days I earn my living teaching school, not leading worship, and while I still dream of opening a small restaurant in Clarkesville or volunteering at an eye clinic in Nepal, there is no guarantee that I will not run off with the circus before I am through. This is not the life I planned, or the life I recommend to others. But it is the life that has turned out to be mine, and the central revelation in it for me -- that the call to serve God is first and last the call to be fully human -- seems important enough to witness to on paper. This book is my attempt to do that.After nine years serving on the staff of a big urban church in Atlanta, Barbara Brown Taylor arrives in rural Clarkesville, Georgia (population 1,500), following her dream to become the pastor of her own small congregation. The adjustment from city life to country dweller is something of a shock -- Taylor is one of the only professional women in the community -- but small-town life offers many of its own unique joys. Taylor has five successful years that see significant growth in the church she serves, but ultimately she finds herself experiencing ""compassion fatigue"" and wonders what exactly God has called her to do. She realizes that in order to keep her faith she may have to leave.Taylor describes a rich spiritual journey in which God has given her more questions than answers. As she becomes part of the flock instead of the shepherd, she describes her poignant and sincere struggle to regain her footing in the world without her defining collar.

Written as a result of the author's Greek travels and studies, Cassandra speaks to us in a pressing monologue whose inner focal points are patriarchy and war. In the four accompanying pieces, which take the form of travel reports, journal entries, and a letter, Wolf describes the novel's genesis. Incisive and intelligent, the entire volume represents an urgent call to examine the past in order to insure a future.	320	May 1st 1988			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153482.Cassandra

The Heart of the World: A Journey to the Last Secret Place		['Ian Baker', 'Dalai Lama XIV']	4.06	666	77	{5: '269', 4: '222', 3: '133', 2: '28', 1: '14'}	"The myth of Shangri-la originates in Tibetan Buddhist beliefs in beyul, or hidden lands, sacred sanctuaries that reveal themselves to devout pilgrims and in times of crisis. The more remote and inaccessible the beyul, the vaster its reputed qualities. Ancient Tibetan prophecies declare that the greatest of all hidden lands lies at the heart of the forbidding Tsangpo Gorge, deep in the Himalayas and veiled by a colossal waterfall. Nineteenth-century accounts of this fabled waterfall inspired a series of ill-fated European expeditions that ended prematurely in 1925 when the intrepid British plant collector Frank Kingdon-Ward penetrated all but a five-mile section of the Tsangpo's innermost gorge and declared that the falls were no more than a ""religious myth"" and a ""romance of geography."" The heart of the Tsangpo Gorge remained a blank spot on the map of world exploration until world-class climber and Buddhist scholar Ian Baker delved into the legends. Whatever cryptic Tibetan scrolls or past explorers had said about the Tsangpo's innermost gorge, Baker determined, could be verified only by exploring the uncharted five-mile gap. After several years of encountering sheer cliffs, maelstroms of impassable white water, and dense leech-infested jungles, on the last of a series of extraordinary expeditions, Baker and his National Geographic-sponsored team reached the depths of the Tsangpo Gorge. They made news worldwide by finding there a 108-foot-high waterfall, the legendary grail of Western explorers and Tibetan seekers alike.  ""The Heart of the World"" is one of the most captivating stories of exploration and discovery in recent memory-an extraordinary journey to one of the wildest and most inaccessible places on earth and a pilgrimage to the heart of the Tibetan Buddhist faith."	511	November 4th 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/406987.The_Heart_of_the_World

To some, it's a comforting thought: no clash of civilizations, no holy wars, no terrorists.But what if that weren't the case at all? In A WORLD WITHOUT ISLAM, Graham E. Fuller guides us along an illuminating journey through history, geopolitics, and religion to investigate whether or not Islam is indeed the cause of some of today's most emotional and important international crises. Fuller takes us from the birth of Islam to the fall of Rome to the rise and collapse of the Ottoman Empire. He examines and analyzes the roots of terrorism, the conflict in Israel, and the role of Islam in supporting and energizing the anti-imperial struggle. Provocatively, he finds that contrary to the claims of many politicians, thinkers, theologians, and soldiers, a world without Islam might not look vastly different from what we know today.Filled with fascinating details and counterintuitive conclusions, A WORLD WITHOUT ISLAM is certain to inspire debate and reshape the way we think about Islam's relationship with the West.	336	August 11th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7193774-a-world-without-islam

Штамата на Енхалон		Ненад Јолдески	4.38	8	0	{5: '4', 4: '3', 3: '1', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	„Најинтересното кај Јолдески е што во неговите раскази совршено се преплетуваат традиционалното и, би рекле дури, хипермодерното. Мекиот, речиси „битов“ реализам се вкрстува со некои мошне современи „постмодерни“ книжевни постапки (интересни се, на пример, реферирањата на важните претходници: Крсте Чачански, Ристо Крле, Константин Миладинов, Чехов...)Расказите најчесто се минималистички сведени. Авторот ја поседува дарбата текстот да го прочисти од сето она што би го оптоварувало, па затоа не се соочуваме со претерувања и застранувања од она што е главен тек на приказната. Иако некои од расказите на прв поглед делуваат адегдотално, функционалноста на раскажување и хуморот ги ослободуваат од можната баналност. Јолдески има одлично чувство за заокруженост и целовитост на приказната, без разлика на нејзината должина или тема.Ненад Јолдески е автор кој сосема опуштено, би можеле да речеме во кроки манир, ни ја скицира реалноста што нè опкружува, при што во неговите раскази поминуваат многубројни необични, гротескни, но истовремено и за нашиот контекст препознатливи ликови. Сите тие се портретирани во стилот на добродушен хуморист кој се насмевнува на човечките слабости и откачености со хумана и емпатична насмевка.На ниво на јазикот, исто така, дијалектот, сленгот и литературниот македонски се ставени во мошне суптилни созвучја. При сета таа стилска слоевитост крајниот резултат не изгледа вештачки и исфорсирано туку совршено складно: книжевните алузии се ставени во функција на непретенциозните и мошне духовити драмски ситуации од секојдневниот живот, што придонесува питките раскази (без ронка баналност!, што е ретка вештина) на Јолдески да течат со леснотија и да се читаат со пријатна топлина околу срцето.“					https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13512323

Ride along on this breath stopping journey of the heart, mind and soul of a 19 year old Marine to 1969 Vietnam. It's a full ride."" This story will grab hold of you and not let go. A uniquely powerful departure from the genre of War literature. Funny, brutal, insightful, intimate...the narrative moves in the cadence of memories told as stories over a camp-fire. Thompson transports you into the mind-space of his 19 year-old self, poignantly reminding us that teenagers, boys even, fought this war, grew up there, grew old there, changed forever there. This memoir is a tour in Vietnam like it was: difficult, fear-filled, deep friendships, confusion, anger, humorous, sadness, grief and horror. It easily can stand beside such memoirs as Robert Graves; ""Good Bye to All That."" Students of history will find this book engrossing as a personal account of the average guy's experience in war. Students of Vietnam will experience a virtual reality tour in Nam through Thompson. His description of action is so realistic, so emotionally compelling, that you live Thompson's tour. Yet, he does not blame the system, the government or the military for his tour. He simply allows you to enter 1960s Vietnam in a way that will change your opinion of those who lived it. You also find out why it was his ""Year of the Rat."	234	February 22nd 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16119055-everything-happened-in-vietnam

In ""First Corinthians,"" Raymond Collins explores that vantage point as well as the challenge Paul posed to the people of his time - and continues to pose in ours - to allow the gospel message to engage them in their daily lives.Pal introduces us to a flesh-and-blood community whose humanness was al too apparent. Sex, death, and money were among the issues they had to face. Social conflicts and tension within their Christian community were part of their daily lives. Paul uses al of his diplomacy, rhetorical skill, and authority to exhort the Corinthian community to be as one in Christ.In examining Paul's message and method, Collins approaches 1 Corinthians as a Hellenistic letter written to people dealing with real issues in the Hellenistic world. He cites existing Hellenistic letters to show that Paul was truly a letter writer of his own times. Collins makes frequent references to the writings of the philosophic moralists to help clarify the way in which Paul spoke to his beloved Corinthians. He also comments on some aspects of the social circumstances in which the Christians of Corinth actually lived.Chapters are Introduction""; *Translation, Interpretation, Notes -; *Body of the Letter -; *Indexes. -""Raymond Collins, PhD is a priest of the Diocese of Providence and is the dean of the School of Religious Studies at The Catholic University of America.

Thus begins Enaiat's remarkable and often punish­ing five-year ordeal, which takes him through Iran, Turkey, and Greece before he seeks political asylum in Italy at the age of fifteen.

What’s that Super Model Doing in my Workplace?		Halinka Panzera	4.25	4	1		"In What's that Super Model doing in My Workplace?, author Halinka Panzera explains why now given Globalisation and faltering economies we need to seek leaders with different characteristics. Social and economic change means that business behaviour needs to adapt. A profit-only, homogeneous male-dominated, institutionalised, single-minded approach to business will no longer secure business success in the future. We are already seeing decline in corporate performance among companies that are adhering to older models. A more broad-minded, balanced outlook that incorporates wider societal characteristics and priorities is needed. An organisation needs to develop a wide range of solutions to any given problem. Says Halinka Panzera, ""When organisations try to replicate the type of leadership they have had in the past, they don't maximise their problem solving. This 'dinosaur' style has had its day"". The Super Model has been created by research insights and provides a new approach for problem solving for CEO's, HR, Management, and new Leaders. Corporate evolution is possible, with insightful, evolving and confident people leading the way and willing to embrace change by contributing diverse thoughts, ideas and perspectives. This book shows you how."	168	February 22nd 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13549588-what-s-that-super-model-doing-in-my-workplace
Hardy Californians: A Woman's Life with Native Plants		Lester Rowntree	3.70	23	9	{5: '6', 4: '7', 3: '7', 2: '3', 1: '0'}	Lester G. E. Rowntree (1879-1979), free-spirited adventurer and pioneering botanist, was fifty-two when she traded a comfortable home for the life of a peripatetic traveler in the California mountains, deserts, and forests. Through hundreds of magazine and journal articles, two acclaimed books, and uncounted public lectures, Rowntree shared her vast knowledge of California native plants and at the same time argued passionately for the protection of the state's bountiful flora. A mountain mystic who worshipped on Sierra peaks, bathed in alpine streams, and lived for months on beans and bread, Rowntree has remained an inspiration in native plant horticulture and plant conservation to this day.A beloved classic first published in 1936, Hardy Californians is Rowntree's poetic sketch of California and its plant life. In charming prose, she takes us along on her annual seed-collecting journey through the state and gives a concise introduction to the complexities of California flora, climate, and geography.

The Redemption of Lord Rawlings	House of Renwick #3	Rachel Van Dyken	3.92	833	38	{5: '270', 4: '298', 3: '209', 2: '42', 1: '14'}	Phillip Crawford, the eighth Earl of Rawlings and notorious rake of the ton, has come to the end of his rope. Out of money, out of favor, and out of luck, he wanders the streets of London in the rain, hoping to be hit by inspiration...or a runaway carriage. Something has to give. It is his father's final cruel trick to hold his inheritance just out of reach, requiring him to marry by his next birthday in order to claim his full rights as earl. His step-mother refuses to offer him any more support. With no money, no prospects and no other place to turn, he has only two options.Marriage or debtor's prison.Book Three of the House of Renwick Series:The better choice seems clear enough, but with his name and reputation being attacked daily in the society papers, there's not a proper lady in all of London desperate enough to accept him. It isn't going to be easy, even if the reports of his exploits and rakish lifestyle are greatly exaggerated.On the other hand, debtor's prison does start to look much more appealing when the only friends he has left decide to help him in his search for the perfect bride. Matters become much more complicated when the only woman who shows an interest in him just happens to be the young sister-in-law of the Duke of Tempest; the same man who, just months ago, had been tempted to kill him.One thing is for certain, as the Season draws to an end, Lord Rawlings will have to decide once and for all, if his wicked ways are enough to bring him contentment in life, or if a leopard really can change his spots. Or in Phillip's case—can a devil truly be redeemed?	195	March 29th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13564697-the-redemption-of-lord-rawlings

The Language of Light		Nadine   May	5.00	2	1		It is possible to communicate with every person on the planet, regardless of what language they speak.This fully illustrated mind drawing workbook takes the reader on an inner journey by tapping into the language of their soul.When the soul descended from the higher spiritual plane and took on human form, the individual lost their memory of how to access the Language of Light. Written as a companion piece to her Awakening series, Nadine May offers the reader an opportunity to awaken those lost memories and as a result achieve a higher level of consciousness. Guiding the reader through the five stages of creativity, Nadine provides the tools to understanding the subconscious through the drawings that one produces and hence makes it possible to connect with the soul on a much deeper level and makes the process of awakening that much easier.Mind drawing and doodling takes the reader on a creative journey about themselves. By learning how to interpret and understand the symbolic language and the colour vibrations of their own drawings, a symbolic language appears. These symbols form an expression of a soul quality.

An Old Black Marble		Florin Nicoara	5.00	3	1		“One day I looked into the mirror and I was old. I looked out the window and saw that I was rich. I looked at my family and saw that it was good.

Surrounded by danger, the four Elementals quickly embrace their new-found super-powered control of the elements—wind, fire, water and stone—under the guidance of Sensei, an imprisoned freedom fighter who believes that Devidis’ near omnipotence is a clear sign that the world is a persistent illusion in the mind of its evil emperor. And so the Elementals are forced to come of age in an increasingly hostile land.

Simplicity Parenting: Using the Extraordinary Power of Less to Raise Calmer, Happier, and More Secure Kids		['Kim John Payne', 'Lisa M. Ross']	4.18	9151	1104	{5: '3903', 4: '3470', 3: '1405', 2: '291', 1: '82'}	Today’s busier, faster, supersized society is waging an undeclared war . . . on childhood. As the pace of life accelerates to hyperspeed–with too much stuff, too many choices, and too little time–children feel the pressure. They can become anxious, have trouble with friends and school, or even be diagnosed with behavioral problems. Now, in defense of the extraordinary power of less, internationally renowned family consultant Kim John Payne helps parents reclaim for their children the space and freedom that all kids need, allowing their children’s attention to focus and their individuality to flourish.Based on Payne’s twenty year’s experience successfully counseling busy families, Simplicity Parenting teaches parents how to worry and hover less–and how to enjoy more. For those who want to slow their children’s lives down but don’t know where to start, Payne offers both inspiration and a blueprint for change.• Streamline your home environment. The average child has more than 150 toys. Here are tips for reducing the amount of toys, books, and clutter–as well as the lights, sounds, and general sensory overload that crowd the space young imaginations need in order to grow.• Establish rhythms and rituals. Predictability (routines) and transparency (knowing the day’s plan) are soothing pressure valves for children. Here are ways to ease daily tensions, create battle-free mealtimes and bedtimes, and tell if your child is overwhelmed.• Schedule a break in the schedule. Too many activities may limit children’s ability to motivate and direct themselves. Learn how to establish intervals of calm in your child’s daily torrent of constant doing–and familiarize yourself with the pros and cons of organized sports and other “enrichment” activities.• Scale back on media and parental involvement. Back out of hyperparenting by managing your children’s “screen time” to limit the endless and sometimes scary deluge of information and stimulation. Parental hovering is really about anxiety; by doing less and trusting more, parents can create a sanctuary that nurtures children’s identity, well-being, and resiliency as they grow–slowly–into themselves. A manifesto for protecting the grace of childhood, Simplicity Parenting is an eloquent guide to bringing new rhythms to bear on the lifelong art of parenting.	256	August 25th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6129974-simplicity-parenting

Basically, this dude is a comedic Cthulhu, and when you read this book, you will either go COMPLETELY MAD or BECOME A SLAVE TO HIS MAD GENIUS. Pray for the latter."" —John Hodgman""This book should affirm Dave Hill's rightful place as a major American humor writer. You will laugh. Buy two and brighten a friend's life as well."" —Dick CavettFrom the Book Jacket:Dear ridiculously attractive person who just so happens to be holding Tasteful Nudes in his or her soft and supple yet commanding hands,Hi. My name is Dave, and this is my very first collection of essays. As you can probably imagine, it pretty much has everything. In fact, if you like stories about stolen meat, animal attacks, young love, death, naked people, clergymen, rock 'n' roll, irritable Canadians, and prison, you have just hit a street called Easy because my book talks about all that stuff and a bunch of other stuff, too.Getting back to that prison thing for a second—I can think of almost no better place to read my book than from within the confines of a correctional facility. For starters, you will definitely have the time. Also, cozying up with a good book in front of your fellow inmates is a great way to show them a softer side that for some reason no one ever wants to hear about in the yard.Fear not, though, non-convicts, my book makes for a solid read outside of prison, too. At the beach, on the subway, while whitewater rafting, during couples counseling, under local anesthesia—I have personally seen to it that my book is totally readable in all these scenarios, as well as in most other scenarios out there today. It will make you laugh, cry, and maybe even think so much that you will forget all your problems while simultaneously creating a few new ones. In limited instances it has been known to cause severe dehydration and the occasional groin pull, but honestly I don't know what that's about. That said, it's probably not a bad idea to keep a glass of water handy and really stretch things out before strapping yourself in for a literary thrill ride you will want to experience again and again until you are either dead or your eyesight fails completely, whichever comes first. In fact, if I end up being wrong about any of this stuff, you can kick me right in the privates. Also, I will send you a nice ham (serves twenty). In short, you really can't lose on this one.Your man,Dave Hill"	240	May 22nd 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13167125-tasteful-nudes-and-other-misguided-attempts-at-personal-growth-and-valid

Samantha must stop this insane beast of hatred and rage and save humankind not only from themselves, but Demonno as well. Samantha must find the strength within to carry the Mystique and humankind alike into a new age and a new millennium, because a new time and existence is about to begin. What is life? Life is the decisions we choose to make woven among our destiny and in the end, all is as it should be.	424	September 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604852-mystique

Many years later, a study was written about the survival of mankind in Sol Four (Mars) and its struggle in Sol Three (Earth). We proved to be a species that has survived wars, slavery and other forms of abuse -- always holding on to our faith in God.Doctor Ajidan Edejem, after finding out that his world was going to die, embarks in the dangerous mission to rescue as many people as possible and search for a new world. All the while, the government wants to keep everything quiet and even kill him for telling others about the unavoidable doom.""We discovered that the seismic activity is increasing and becoming more frequent causing volcanic eruptions, which increase the volume of sulfates in the atmosphere and break down Ozone. In other words, the atmosphere of this planet is bleeding into space. At the rate these phenomena are taking place, life on Taerr will no longer be supported in less than a month's time. The only way for our species to survive is to travel to another habitable planet. In our research, we have found a planet close to ours with a similar atmosphere about three months away. We have prepared a fleet of ships to take as many citizens as possible to this new planet.

Skeezie Tookis and Addie Carle and Joe Bunch and me. We call ourselves the Gang of Five, but there are only four of us. We do it to keep people on their toes. Make 'em wonder. Or maybe we do it because we figure that there's one more kid out there who's going to need a gang to be a part of. A misfit, like us.  Skeezie, Addie, Joe, and Bobby -- they've been friends forever. They laugh together, have lunch together, and get together once a week at the Candy Kitchen to eat ice cream and talk about important issues. Life isn't always fair, but at least they have each other -- and all they really want to do is survive the seventh grade.  That turns out to be more of a challenge than any of them had anticipated. Starting with Addie's refusal to say the Pledge of Allegiance and her insistence on creating a new political party to run for student council, the Gang of Five is in for the ride of their lives. Along the way they will learn about politics and popularity, love and loss, and what it means to be a misfit. After years of getting by, they are given the chance to stand up and be seen -- not as the one-word jokes their classmates have tried to reduce them to, but as the full, complicated human beings they are just beginning to discover they truly are.	288	October 1st 2001	['Joe Bunch', 'Bobby Goodspeed', 'Colin Briggs', 'Skeezie Tookis']		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/291896.The_Misfits

The Event in Science, History, Philosophy & Art		Yeshayahu Ben-Aharon	4.44	9	2	{5: '6', 4: '1', 3: '2', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	In this book, Dr. Ben-Aharon demonstrates how the transformation of human consciousness in modern times is expressed in the fields of Science, History, Philosophy, and Art. He shows how creative concepts have been discovered and applied in physics, biology, genetics, and artificial intelligence. In the Philosophy chapter, Ben-Aharon traces the thought of Deleuze and Guattari, Foucault, Derrida, Badiou and Levinas and shows that this radical thinking is no longer abstract, theoretical reasoning or mere speculation. Rather, it is an exercise in generating real cognitive and moral substance, taking the human beyond the traditional boundaries of body, subjectivity, and identity. The chapter on Art demonstrates how contemporary artistic work joins together with science and thinking to create a new stream of real becoming and evolution. The historical decision of our time is then: Are we going to apply this new creativity in social life or will we reverse it into its destructive opposite?	248	2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14353765-the-event-in-science-history-philosophy-art

Culled from the seven volumes of his personal journals, this twenty nine year chronicle deepens and extends the story Thomas Merton recounted and made famous in The Seven Storey Mountain. This book is the spiritual autobiography of our century's most celebrated monk -- the wisdom gained from the personal experience of an enduring spiritual teacher. Here is Merton's account of his life's major challenges, his confrontations with monastic and church hierarchies, his interaction with religious traditions east and west, and his antiwar and civil-rights activities. In The Intimate Merton we engage a writer's art of ""confession and witness"" as he searches for a contemporary, authentic, and global spirituality.Recounting Merton's earliest days in the monastery to his journey east to meet the Dalai Lama, The Intimate Merton captures the essence of what makes Thomas Merton's life journey so perennially relevant."	375	February 20th 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/420553.The_Intimate_Merton
Night Terrors: Hallways and Mirrors		Rose Golden	4.00	4	2		I would wake up in the middle of the night; a cold sweat drenching my sheets, gasping for air, my hands racing defensively to my throat. In these brief moments that fallowed, I would always realize two things; one: it all had been a nightmare, a terrible nightmare, and two: the three figures standing at the foot of my bed hadn't disappeared with the scenery, they had fallowed me out. These figures, I knew them too well. Two were men silhouettes and one was female. It wasn't all to surprising how well I knew them, I saw them every night. I would always be running from them in a dark, eerie familiar place. But they would always reach me, pin me down, and begin to choke the life from me. Even after I woke, the pressure around my throat was real and would linger in bruises, and those figures would still be there, staring at me. Doctors called them night terrors. They said they weren't uncommon for children and young teenagers who had recently lost their parents. Only, these started the night of my sixteenth birthday, two weeks before their death.	168	March 20th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14421103-night-terrors

But they may have to.Though they can probably scrape up the price of admission, other obstacles stand in the way. One problem, nobody under 18 years of age is allowed into the show. Dwight, Rusty, and Slim are only 16. Another problem, the show begins at midnight and the three teens always have to be home by then. If that weren't bad enough, the show is to take place at Janks Field -- a desolate patch of ground with a nasty history -- that has been declared off limits by their parentsThe situation appears hopeless.Though Dwight and his friends fear they won't be able to attend the actual performance of the Traveling Vampire Show, they do have the entire day to themselves. Why not hike out to Janks Field and take a look around? With any luck, they might be able to watch the crew make preparations for tonight's performance. If they're really lucky, maybe they'll get a peek at Valeria, the gorgeous vampire.And so the three friends set off on foot for Janks Field...Dwight is a solid, honest kid, long on common sense and loyalty to his friends. He always tries to do what's right.Rusty is a husky guy who relishes trouble.Slim, their long-time pal, is the brains of the outfit, a voracious reader of novels, an aspiring writer, and a girl. Also, she is sometimes too brave for her own good.The Traveling Vampire Show is the tale, told in Dwight's own words, of what happened to him, Rusty and Slim on that hot summer day they hiked to Janks Field.

Reeling from grief, Paul is determined to decipher this evidence and unlock the mystery of her death. But he can't do it alone; he needs Lorelei's help. A linguist by training, Paul embarks on an impossible endeavor: a series of experiments designed to teach Lorelei to communicate what she knows.

Two mighty armies blunder toward each other, one led by confident, beloved Robert E. Lee and the other by dour George Meade. They’ll meet in a Pennsylvania crossroads town where no one planned to fight.
In this sweeping, savagely realistic novel, the greatest battle ever fought on American soil explodes into life at Gettysburg. As generals squabble, staffs err. Tragedy unfolds for immigrants in blue and barefoot Rebels alike. The fate of our nation will be decided in a few square miles of fields.

Following a tough Confederate sergeant from the Blue Ridge, a bitter Irish survivor of the Great Famine, a German political refugee, and gun crews in blue and gray, Cain at Gettysburg is as grand in scale as its depictions of combat are unflinching.

For three days, battle rages. Through it all, James Longstreet is haunted by a vision of war that leads to a fateful feud with Robert E. Lee. Scheming Dan Sickles nearly destroys his own army. Gallant John Reynolds and obstreperous Win Hancock, fiery William Barksdale and dashing James Johnston Pettigrew, gallop toward their fates….

There are no marble statues on this battlefield, only men of flesh and blood, imperfect and courageous. From New York Times bestselling author and former U.S. Army officer Ralph Peters, Cain at Gettysburg is bound to become a classic of men at war.

The Ethics of Liberty		['Murray N. Rothbard', 'Hans-Hermann Hoppe']	4.16	1183	51	{5: '590', 4: '337', 3: '157', 2: '55', 1: '44'}	In recent years, libertarian impulses have increasingly influenced national and economic debates, from welfare reform to efforts to curtail affirmative action. Murray N. Rothbard's classic The Ethics of Liberty stands as one of the most rigorous and philosophically sophisticated expositions of the libertarian political position.What distinguishes Rothbard's book is the manner in which it roots the case for freedom in the concept of natural rights and applies it to a host of practical problems. An economist by profession, Rothbard here proves himself equally at home with philosophy. And while his conclusions are radical--that a social order that strictly adheres to the rights of private property must exclude the institutionalized violence inherent in the state--his applications of libertarian principles prove surprisingly practical for a host of social dilemmas, solutions to which have eluded alternative traditions.The Ethics of Liberty authoritatively established the anarcho-capitalist economic system as the most viable and the only principled option for a social order based on freedom. This edition is newly indexed and includes a new introduction that takes special note of the Robert Nozick-Rothbard controversies.	308	February 1st 2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81983.The_Ethics_of_Liberty

Angelica		Arthur Phillips	3.06	1130	203	{5: '102', 4: '284', 3: '419', 2: '228', 1: '97'}	From the bestselling author of The Egyptologist and Prague comes an even more accomplished and entirely surprising new novel. Angelica is a spellbinding Victorian ghost story, an intriguing literary and psychological puzzle, and a meditation on marriage, childhood, memory, and fear.The novel opens in London, in the 1880s, with the Barton household on the brink of collapse. Mother, father, and daughter provoke one another, consciously and unconsciously, and a horrifying crisis is triggered. As the family's tragedy is told several times from different perspectives, events are recast and sympathies shift.In the dark of night, a chilling sexual spectre is making its way through the house, hovering over the sleeping girl and terrorizing her fragile mother. Are these visions real, or is there something more sinister, and more human, to fear? A spiritualist is summoned to cleanse the place of its terrors, but with her arrival the complexities of motive and desire only multiply. The mother's failing health and the father's many secrets fuel the growing conflicts, while the daughter flirts dangerously with truth and fantasy.While Angelica is reminiscent of such classic horror tales as The Turn of the Screw and The Haunting of Hill House, it is also a thoroughly modern exploration of identity, reality, and love. Set at the dawn of psychoanalysis and the peak of spiritualism's acceptance, Angelica is also an evocative historical novel that explores the timeless human hunger for certainty.BONUS: This edition contains excerpts from Arthur Phillips's The Tragedy of Arthur, The Song Is You, Prague, and The Egyptologist.	352	April 3rd 2007	['Constance Barton', 'Joseph Barton', 'Angelica Barton', 'Anne Montague']	['London, England']	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256397.Angelica

However, what will her fate be when she endeavors to flag down the only lifeguard on duty, the enormously popular and ridiculously beautiful Tristan Daniels? The most sought after and virtually most unattainable guy in school who not only makes Camie’s heart flatline on a recurring basis, he’s also the one guy who seemingly doesn’t know she exists.Feeling like an inept piece of chum that could ultimately be swallowed by Jaws, can Camie get Tristan to rescue her from floundering in the treacherous deep, or is she destined to be Shark Bait?Author's Note: While the tales themselves are fictional, some of the events and characters are very loosely based in reality and on my experiences—but don’t worry, the names of the characters, most of their unfortunate fashion sense and/or questionable taste in music has been changed to protect the not-so innocent.

And that’s the real problem.Now, with his wedding fast approaching, Rob suddenly finds himself paralyzed with indecision–about Every. Little. Thing.

Should he step out of the shower with his left leg or his right leg? Red sweater or blue?

The Burning Cedars		Ramzy Baroody	3.00	2	1		The Burning Cedars provides a poignant and pragmatic account of the Lebanese civil war and ensuing turmoil while candidly unraveling the intricate secrets and at times turbulent relationships of a family whose heartbreaking struggles and emotional triumphs extended over three generations. The unpredictable and surprising turns and twists of each chapter continue to resonate with readers long after the last page has been turned over. At a time when Lebanon was thrust into the grips of a long and vicious civil war, the author offers an honest, sometimes tragic, sometimes funny, but always heartfelt view of his fascinating country and its people. The Burning Cedars follows the life of a privileged young boy whose grandfather, a prominent village doctor amassed great wealth and power only to have it squandered away by the family or destroyed during the war. The grandmother, a powerful and domineering woman whose intense hatred for the boy's mother ignited the flames of a volatile relationship which could be described as cruel at best. The distant and uncaring brother and the unmarried and loving uncle, who concealed a deep and unforgiving illness, must all work together as a family to survive the atrocities of the war. In the midst of all the chaos, the young boy's own struggles with loneliness, fear and sadness are revealed, while happier days spent in Egypt and America all come together seamlessly in this fascinating and gripping true story.	312	2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15760702-the-burning-cedars
Domingo's Angel		Jenny Twist	4.55	88	38	{5: '64', 4: '13', 3: '7', 2: '3', 1: '1'}	When Angela turns up in a remote Spanish mountain village, she is so tall and so thin and so pale that everyone thinks she is a ghost or a fairy or the dreadful mantequero that comes in the night and sucks the fat from your bones. But Domingo knows better. “Soy Angela,” she said to him when they met – “I am an angel.” Only later did he realise that she was telling him her name and by then it was too late and everyone knew her as Domingo’s Angel. This is the story of their love affair. But it is also the story of the people of the tiny mountain village – the indomitable Rosalba - shopkeeper, doctor, midwife and wise woman, who makes it her business to know everything that goes on in the village; Guillermo, the mayor, whose delusions of grandeur are rooted in his impoverished childhood; and Salva the Baker, who risked his life and liberty to give bread to the starving children.The events in this story are based on the real experiences of the people of the White Villages in Southern Spain and their struggle to keep their communities alive through the years of war and the oppression of Franco’s rule.	175	July 10th 2011		['Spain']	https://gc.kis.v2.scr.kaspersky-labs.com/E3E8934C-235A-4B0E-825A-35A08381A191/abn/main.css?attr=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZHJlYWRzLmNvbS9ib29rL3Nob3cvMTIwMzIzNTctZG9taW5nby1zLWFuZ2Vs

Imaginings of Sand depicts the country as it makes the transition to democracy, just as Kristien Muller returns from self-imposed exile to the bedside of her dying grandmother, Ouma Kristina. At age 103 matriarchal Ouma is a fountain of family history and white South African legend, and to her grandaughter she passes on tales--magically unreal at times--that link the oppression suffered by women and blacks. While immersed in these fables of memory and emotion, Kristien must also deal with the current reality: a hostile family and authorities discomfited by the impending transition of power.

Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software		Eric Evans	4.15	4164	197	{5: '1827', 4: '1458', 3: '645', 2: '160', 1: '74'}	"""Eric Evans has written a fantastic book on how you can make the design of your software match your mental model of the problem domain you are addressing. ""His book is very compatible with XP. It is not about drawing pictures of a domain; it is about how you think of it, the language you use to talk about it, and how you organize your software to reflect your improving understanding of it. Eric thinks that learning about your problem domain is as likely to happen at the end of your project as at the beginning, and so refactoring is a big part of his technique. ""The book is a fun read. Eric has lots of interesting stories, and he has a way with words. I see this book as essential reading for software developers--it is a future classic."" --Ralph Johnson, author of Design Patterns ""If you don't think you are getting value from your investment in object-oriented programming, this book will tell you what you've forgotten to do. ""Eric Evans convincingly argues for the importance of domain modeling as the central focus of development and provides a solid framework and set of techniques for accomplishing it. This is timeless wisdom, and will hold up long after the methodologies du jour have gone out of fashion."" --Dave Collins, author of Designing Object-Oriented User Interfaces  ""Eric weaves real-world experience modeling--and building--business applications into a practical, useful book. Written from the perspective of a trusted practitioner, Eric's descriptions of ubiquitous language, the benefits of sharing models with users, object life-cycle management, logical and physical application structuring, and the process and results of deep refactoring are major contributions to our field."" --Luke Hohmann, author of Beyond Software Architecture  ""This book belongs on the shelf of every thoughtful software developer."" --Kent Beck ""What Eric has managed to capture is a part of the design process that experienced object designers have always used, but that we have been singularly unsuccessful as a group in conveying to the rest of the industry. We've given away bits and pieces of this knowledge...but we've never organized and systematized the principles of building domain logic. This book is important."" --Kyle Brown, author of Enterprise Java(TM) Programming with IBM(R) WebSphere(R) The software development community widely acknowledges that domain modeling is central to software design. Through domain models, software developers are able to express rich functionality and translate it into a software implementation that truly serves the needs of its users. But despite its obvious importance, there are few practical resources that explain how to incorporate effective domain modeling into the software development process.  Domain-Driven Design  fills that need. This is not a book about specific technologies. It offers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design, presenting an extensive set of design best practices, experience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that facilitate the development of software projects facing complex domains. Intertwining design and development practice, this book incorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to illustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world software development. Readers learn how to use a domain model to make a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. A core of best practices and standard patterns provides a common language for the development team. A shift in emphasis--refactoring not just the code but the model underlying the code--in combination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads to deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between domain expert and programmer.  Domain-Driven Design  then builds on this foundation, and addresses modeling and design for complex systems and larger organizations.Specific topics covered include:Getting all team members to speak the same language Connecting model and implementation more deeply Sharpening key distinctions in a model Managing the lifecycle of a domain object Writing domain code that is safe to combine in elaborate ways Making complex code obvious and predictable Formulating a domain vision statement Distilling the core of a complex domain Digging out implicit concepts needed in the model Applying analysis patterns Relating design patterns to the model Maintaining model integrity in a large system Dealing with coexisting models on the same project Organizing systems with large-scale structures Recognizing and responding to modeling breakthroughs With this book in hand, object-oriented developers, system analysts, and designers will have the guidance they need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful domain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting software implementations."	560	August 20th 2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179133.Domain_Driven_Design

What is the Christian message in a society marked by religious pluralism, ethnic diversity, and cultural relativism? Should Christians encountering today's pluralist society concentrate on evangelism or on dialogue? How does the prevailing climate of opinion affect, perhaps infect, Christians' faith?These kinds of questions are addressed in this noteworthy book by Lesslie Newbigin. A highly respected Christian leader and ecumenical figure, Newbigin provides a brilliant analysis of contemporary (secular, humanist, pluralist) culture and suggests how Christians can more confidently affirm their faith in such a context.While drawing from scholars such as Michael Polanyi, Alasdair MacIntyre, Hendrikus Berkhof, Walter Wink, and Robert Wuthnow, The Gospel in a Pluralist Society is suited not only to an academic readership. This heartfelt work by a missionary pastor and preacher also offers to Christian leaders and laypeople some thoughtful, helpful, and provocative reflections.	264	October 30th 1989			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/851927.The_Gospel_in_a_Pluralist_Society

One Dress.A tale of faith, redemption, and timeless love.Charlotte owns a chic Birmingham bridal boutique. Dressing brides for their big day is her gift . . . and her passion. But with her own wedding day approaching, why can't she find the perfect dress...or feel certain she should marry Tim?Then Charlotte discovers a vintage dress in a battered trunk at an estate sale. It looks brand-new-shimmering with pearls and satin, hand-stitched and timeless in its design. But where did it come from? Who wore it? Who welded the lock shut and tucked the dog tags in that little sachet? Who left it in the basement for a ten-year-old girl? And what about the mysterious man in the purple vest who insists the dress had been ""redeemed.""Charlotte's search for the gown's history-and its new bride-begins as a distraction from her sputtering love life. But it takes on a life of its own as she comes to know the women who have worn the dress. Emily from 1912. Mary Grace from 1939. Hillary from 1968. Each with her own story of promise, pain, and destiny. And each with something unique to share.

Loss De Plott		Stephan J. Myers	4.32	34	20	{5: '21', 4: '8', 3: '1', 2: '3', 1: '1'}	"""A fable for grownups who believe it is never too late to change.""Don't let the illustrations fool you; Loss De Plott is as thought provoking as it gets. A fable for grownups, who believe it is never too late to change and understand the power of now, Loss will re-ignite your hunger for answers and will take you on a journey of discovery, where the stakes could not be higher.A chilling view of the future unfolds as the boundaries of time unravel and characters that might well shape our future are revealed. Meet Slothman, Wordsmith and the haunting Dark Whisperers and you will learn that it really is never too late to change.Myers has created a truly unique blending of illustrations and words, in a book that is impossible to put down. Written with a Dickensian lilt and the cadence of a musical score; the tale is told by a mysterious narrator who wakes, without his memory, only to find the elfin like Loss levitating before him.""What ......does it look like,"" she asks. And when a parade of odd looking doors appear in his mind he realizes that, if he is to resolve the mystery of his peculiar circumstances, there are answers he must find. Thus begins a fable that, by revealing what is really important in life, might well change your view of the world forever.Simple, yet deceptively complex, fragments of this endearing fable can be found in literature, religions and philosophies across the centuries. Yet, when all is said and done, they come down to one solitary word. A word that has both the power to create; the power to destroy the world of tomorrow and upon which rests the future of children everywhere.In the words of Stephan J Myers......Even in this digital age there is no diary we might consult more than that of memory and it often seems to me that the oldest of memories linger longest for the dreams that never die. Constant whispers that remind us all of those halcyon days of youth, when the great expectations for our lives ahead were yet untainted by the realities of life.That everything changes is perhaps the most enduring of universal truths. Yet even that for which we have most longed might often be tinged by sadness, for fundamental to change are the choices we must make. With the years I have come to realise that each step we take in life might be regretted once we begin to dwell upon those other steps we might have taken. More, there seems to me a time for each of us when we might ask what if?Loss De Plott is above all the sum of those choices we might make. Unashamedly written with a Dickensian lilt and some rather quirky illustrations I wanted to write a book which the reader could not skim across the pages, but be encouraged to find an accord between images and words. Both mediums layered upon each other with the greatest of care, that they might reflect the simplicity and complexity with which we weave the patterns of our lives. More, I want you to never forget the characters Loss meets on her travels. The gross Slothman, the devilish Teller Of Tales and of course the Whisperers In The Dark.Find the rhythm in the words and reach once again for those halcyon days of youth. So that we might never forget we are each and every one of us the stuff of dreams and though we might be grownups, it is never too late to change.Stephan J Myers, July 2012."	86	July 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15748083-loss-de-plott

Describing the experiences of twenty ordinary people from around the world, all now unknown, he explores the everyday aspects of war: not only the tragedy and horror, but also the absurdity, monotony and even beauty. Two of these twenty will perish, two will become prisoners of war, two will become celebrated heroes and two others end up as physical wrecks. One of them goes mad, another will never hear a shot fired.Following soldiers and sailors, nurses and government workers, from Britain, Russia, Germany, Australia and South America - and in theatres of war often neglected by major histories on the period - Englund reconstructs their feelings, impressions, experiences and moods. This is a piece of anti-history: it brings this epoch-making event back to its smallest component, the individual.	488	October 27th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10900053-the-beauty-and-the-sorrow

I am an Emotional Creature		Eve Ensler	4.02	2994	366	{5: '1165', 4: '989', 3: '620', 2: '167', 1: '53'}	In this daring, provocative, and insightful book, bestselling author and internationally acclaimed playwright Eve Ensler writes fictional monologues and stories inspired by girls around the globe. Moving through a world of topics and emotions, these voices are fierce, alive, tender, complicated, imaginative, and smart. Girls today often find themselves in a struggle between remaining strong and true to themselves and conforming to society’s expectations in an attempt to please. They are taught not to be too intense, too passionate, too smart, too caring, too open. They are encouraged to shut down their instincts, their outrage, their desires and their dreams, to be polite, to obey the rules. I Am an Emotional Creature is a celebration of the authentic voice inside every girl and an inspiring call to action for girls everywhere to speak up, follow their dreams, and become the women they were always meant to be.Among the girls Ensler creates are an American who struggles with peer pressure in a suburban high school; an anorexic blogging as she eats less and less; a Masai girl from Kenya unwilling to endure female genital mutilation; a Bulgarian sex slave, no more than fifteen, a Chinese factory worker making Barbies; an Iranian student who is tricked into a nose job; a pregnant girl trying to decide if she should keep her baby.Through rants, poetry, questions, and facts, we come to understand the universality of girls everywhere: their resiliency, their wildness, their pain, their fears, their secrets, and their triumphs. I Am an Emotional Creature is a call, a reckoning, an education, an act of empowerment for girls, and an illumination for parents and for us all.	176	February 9th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6979094-i-am-an-emotional-creature

Is That a Fish in Your Ear? Translation and the Meaning of Everything		David Bellos	3.78	2245	322	{5: '509', 4: '931', 3: '645', 2: '131', 1: '29'}	"Funny and surprising on every page, Is That a Fish in Your Ear? offers readers new insight into the mystery of how we come to know what someone else means—whether we wish to understand Astérix cartoons or a foreign head of state. Using translation as his lens, David Bellos shows how much we can learn about ourselves by exploring the ways we use translation, from the historical roots of written language to the stylistic choices of Ingmar Bergman, from the United Nations General Assembly to the significance of James Cameron's Avatar.Is That a Fish in Your Ear? ranges across human experience to describe why translation sits deep within us all, and why we need it in so many situations, from the spread of religion to our appreciation of literature; indeed, Bellos claims that all writers are by definition translators. Written with joie de vivre, reveling both in misunderstanding and communication, littered with wonderful asides, it promises any reader new eyes through which to understand the world. In the words of Bellos: ""The practice of translation rests on two presuppositions. The first is that we are all different: we speak different tongues, and see the world in ways that are deeply influenced by the particular features of the tongue that we speak. The second is that we are all the same—that we can share the same broad and narrow kinds of feelings, information, understandings, and so forth. Without both of these suppositions, translation could not exist. Nor could anything we would like to call social life. Translation is another name for the human condition."""	390	October 25th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11431000-is-that-a-fish-in-your-ear-translation-and-the-meaning-of-everything

Earth Sink		Ilyan Kei Lavanway	3.25	4	3		Earth Sink is a challenging and insightful read that demands an attentive mind and some awareness of the sociopolitical trends going on in America and around the world. Secret societies, banking cartels, and terrorist regimes have been funding and grooming political candidates for the highest offices of American government. A one man sleeper cell has been in play since 2008. The American people blindly voted him into position. Or did they? In a day when it is becoming a crime to worship Jesus Christ, signs of the times and biblical prophecies are unfolding at ever increasing rates. The story starts way back in a time veiled from your mind, when you fought a war you don't remember, a war for your very right to be born. Events playing out on Earth are extensions of that war. The original foes know you better than you know yourself, and they cannot be killed. They were never alive. The story is a fictional dramatization framed around principles of eternal truth. Earth Sink will penetrate your soul to the core. You will not be able to remain neutral or indifferent after reading this book in its entirety. The open minded reader will find answers to some of man’s most profound questions and will likely come away with even more questions and some intensely emotional opinions. Earth Sink contains personal dreams experienced by the author and is based in part on the author's dreams. It is written mostly in narrative form with very little dialog. The eternal future of every individual on earth, alive or dead, hangs in the balance. A simple vicarious work can tip the scales toward eternal life. The sheer volume of vicarious work to be done is astronomical. Scant few ever attempt it. Will they endure long enough to complete the work, or will they succumb to the swelling tides of evil? While offering insights into theological anthropology and eschatology, Earth Sink depicts the tragic results of prevailing modern societal trends. The book exposes the primordial roots of political influences operating works of darkness that drive a progressive global state of affairs that exclusively favors the world's elites at the expense of liberty and individual freedoms. Earth Sink warns about the deliberate dismantling of the United States constitution from the inside by a compromised and corrupted executive branch of American government collaborating with secret combinations of banking cartels, mega corporations, and terrorist organizations. The most powerful position in the world is handed over to diabolical figures bent on seating a world government that opposes every virtue that once set mankind above beasts. The catastrophic consequences of globalized mainstream sociopolitical movements leading up to the second coming of Jesus Christ are unrelentingly drilled home in overwhelmingly graphic detail unleashed from the vivid and explosive imagination of the author. Earth Sink does not skimp on cataclysmic mayhem and apocalyptic doom. Take heed if you want to live. End times have already been underway longer than you realize. Earth Sink is a scathing and brutal portent. The author is absolutely unmindful of reader sensitivity. He employs no semblance of political correctness. Some readers may find parts of the story extremely disturbing, offensive, and controversial. Though written as fiction, the story alludes to the serious truth of what is going on around us and among us right now. In addition to whetting the inquisitive mind with a glimpse of cutting edge science and futuristic technologies, Earth Sink is both politically relevant and spiritually applicable to everyone. It describes a globalized society driven by influences that promote and then exploit worldwide pacifism, greed, envy, pride, and chaos which in turn drives a desperate need for change. Upon that desperate need for change, the world's elites slide into coveted positions of absolute power and total control while their bovine, unthinking constituents and porcine subjects wallow in passive complacency, recklessly relying on the mercies of those they have allowed to gain power over them. All will be well, or will it? Earth Sink extrapolates a possible future from past and present issues. Read the story as if it were real. Some of it is unequivocally real. Some of it may become real. Ponder it carefully and decide for yourself what is real and what is fiction. Beware, your time will soon run out. Earth Sink was written to do more than merely entertain. It was written as a wake up call to change lives, hopefully for the better.	496	May 24th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10922494-earth-sink

There's only one way Shelby and her sisters can describe their mother: She's a sexpot. Helen Kimura collects men (and loans, spending money, and gifts of all kinds) from all over the country. Sure, she's not your typical role model, but she's also not just a pretty face and nail polish. She is confident and brave; she lives life on her own terms, and her four daughters simply adore her. These girls have been raised outside the traditional boundaries. They know how to take the back exit. They know how to dodge crazed lovers in highway car chases. They do not, however, know how to function without one another.  Then suddenly they must. A late-night phone call unexpectedly shreds the family apart, catapulting the girls across the country to live with their respective fathers. But these strong-willed sisters are, like their mother, determined to live life on their own terms, and what they do to pull their family back together is nothing short of beautiful.  At turns wickedly funny and insistently thought-provoking, Outside Beauty showcases Cynthia Kadohata's unerring ability to explore the bonds that bind."	272	June 3rd 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2514746.Outside_Beauty

Un altro scrivere: lettere 1904-1924		['Max Brod', 'Franz Kafka', 'Marco Rispoli', 'Luca Zenobi']	5.00	1	0		Kafka e Max Brod si conobbero, non ancora ventenni, nel 1902. Da quel primo incontro nacque un'amicizia che durò fino alla morte di Kafka nel 1924. Fu un rapporto asimmetrico: da un lato un intellettuale -Brod- che andava riscuotendo un crescente successo fino ad apparire agli occhi dei suoi contemporanei una figura di prima grandezza nella cultura praghese di lingua tedesca, dall'altro uno scrittore che viveva con un misto di vergogna ed orgogliosa consapevolezza il proprio straordinario talento. Fu, però, anche un rapporto decisivo per la vita e l'esistenza postuma di entrambi. Senza Kafka, il nome di Brod sarebbe oggi noto solo a pochi specialisti. Senza Brod, l'opera di Kafka ci sarebbe giunta dimezzata: fu infatti lui a tradire, con provvida infedeltà, le volontà testamentarie dell'amico, che gli aveva chiesto di distruggere tutte le sue carte.Le lettere qui raccolte insieme per la prima volta non soltanto documentano con insolita vivezza questa amicizia, ma forniscono anche una chiave preziosa per l'opera e per la biografia di uno dei massimi scrittori del XX secolo. La vita di Kafka non ci appare qui, secondo uno stereotipo che lo stesso Brod ha contribuito a diffondere, come quella di un santo, ma sotto il segno dell'ironia e della leggerezza. In un fitto intreccio di confidenze, aneddoti, riflessioni, Kafka condivide con Brod ogni aspetto della sua esistenza, dalla composizione dei romanzi fino alle sue tormentate storie d'amore. Nelle reciproche incomprensioni, nelle differenze nel modo di guardare alla vita e alla scrittura, la disparità fra i due autori affiora di continuo, tanto che davvero potrebbe sembrare, come osservò una volta Walter Benjamin, che Kafka abbia voluto porre con questa amicizia un punto di domanda accanto alla sua vita. Ma tanto più grande è la tensione che separa queste due esistenze, tanto più luminose le scintille che il genio di Kafka sa farne scaturire. E l'amicizia con Brod è anche il luogo dove poteva manifestarsi un affetto che, come Kafka scrive a Felice Bauer, «ha le sue radici nel profondo, laggiù dove la letteratura ancora non c'è, in quanto vi è di più umano».	448	April 5th 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16060850-un-altro-scrivere

He clarifies why our civilizations grew up oblivious to each other, what happened when they intersected, and how the Islamic world was affected by its slow recognition that Europe—a place it long perceived as primitive and disorganized—had somehow hijacked destiny.	390	April 27th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34617904-destiny-disrupted

I'm Will		William Haylon	4.12	17	1	{5: '8', 4: '5', 3: '3', 2: '0', 1: '1'}	In his parents’ minds, Will was an underachiever. So they decided he should go to an expensive private high school that they couldn’t really afford. They assumed smaller classes and an ostentatious campus would help him overcome his enduring indifference to growing up. Will watched as his father wrote some great essays for his applications. Still he only got into a single school of the nine to which he applied--off the wait list when another family couldn’t afford the tuition.When Will arrived for his freshman year (or Class IV as the school called it), he quickly recognized he would rather be just about anywhere else. Over the next four years, he grew a foot, developed a dusting of facial hair, and mostly completed over six hundred nights of homework assignments. Among other things, he also was regularly grounded by his parents for uninspiring grades, was caught cheating, was introduced to alcohol, and had his heart tortured by a lesbian schoolmate with whom he was hopelessly in love.His final summer of high school is spent living in a monastery in Connecticut and working in Manhattan. His parents thought living with priests would help him develop more discipline and a healthier set of values. Instead, each evening he rode the commuter train home in the bar car with a group of adults he serendipitously met and provided him with a different kind of education than his parents’ had intended. Will’s life may have lacked purpose, but their standards were well below his own—and yet they were all successful in the ways that his school and his parents measured success.As punishment for some of his high school misadventures, Will had to write a thesis about someone he found interesting. He decided to write about himself. The result is I’m Will which shares an introspective glimpse into his struggle to find himself in the confusing and contradictory world of growing up. As Will says, most of what he wrote is true—at least this is how he remembers it.	287	September 20th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16078921-i-m-will

On The Intuitive Spectrum: A Deeper Look into the Amazing Value of Intuition		Susan Ozimkiewicz	4.00	6	3	{5: '3', 4: '2', 3: '0', 2: '0', 1: '1'}	"The sun god Apollo sentenced Cassandra to be able to prophesy her intuitions but to never be believed. Since ancient times, the gift of prophecy and intuition was a present that was bestowed upon Cassandra by Apollo. Apollo loved Cassandra, and she rejected Apollo's advances toward her. Hence, because she rejected Apollo, this curse is still, in effect, today. Even in the modern-day world intuition is rarely believed or trusted because there is no proof or guarantee. Only after the intuition was seen to be correct do you say, ""Oh, if only I had listened to my intuition."" Susan invites you to explore the depth of intuition with her and discover its worth to you. Perhaps, reminding you that you always wondered about your own intuition but brushed it away and might now reclaim it as a useful tool. A variety of readers will be interested in this book, including therapists, their patients, students of psychology, Jungian scholars, and people of all ages. This book is an exploration and an invitation to everyone to begin to discern and explore within themselves their own subtle intuitive sense perceptions as a cultural value and a personal transformative power."	142	July 2nd 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15885782-on-the-intuitive-spectrum

Life Is Short But Wide		J. California Cooper	3.98	1763	206	{5: '711', 4: '501', 3: '390', 2: '121', 1: '40'}	Beloved writer J. California Cooper has won a legion of loyal fans and much critical acclaim for her powerful storytelling gifts. In language both spare and direct yet wondrously lyrical, LIFE IS SHORT BUT WIDE is an irresistible story of family that proves no matter who you are or what you do, you are never too old to chase your dreams.Like the small towns J. California Cooper has so vividly portrayed in her previous novels and story collections, Wideland, Oklahoma, is home to ordinary Americans struggling to raise families, eke out a living, and fulfill their dreams. In the early twentieth century, Irene and Val fall in love in Wideland. While carving out a home for themselves, they also allow neighbors Bertha and Joseph to build a house and live on their land. The next generation brings two girls for Irene and Val, and a daughter for Bertha and Joseph. As the families cope with the hardships that come with changing times and fortunes, and people are born and pass away, the characters learn the importance of living one’s life boldly and squeezing out every possible moment of joy. Cooper brilliantly captures the cadences of the South and draws a picture of American life at once down-to-earth and heartwarming in this-as her wise narrator will tell you-“strange, sad, kind’a beautiful, life story.” It is a story about love that leads to the ultimate realization that whoever you are, and whatever you do, life is short, but it is also wide.	336	March 24th 2009		['Oklahoma']	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4674126-life-is-short-but-wide

Beautiful Outlaw: Experiencing the Playful, Disruptive, Extravagant Personality of Jesus		John Eldredge	4.33	4132	415	{5: '2237', 4: '1233', 3: '505', 2: '121', 1: '36'}	Reading the Gospels without knowing the personality of Jesus is like watching television with the sound turned off. The result is a dry, two dimensional person doing strange, undecipherable things. In BEAUTIFUL OUTLAW, John Eldredge removes the religious varnish to help readers discover stunning new insights into the humanity of Jesus. He was accused of breaking the law, keeping bad company, heavy drinking. Of being the devil himself. He was so compelling and dangerous they had to kill him. But others loved him passionately. He had a sense of humor. His generosity was scandalous. His anger made enemies tremble. He'd say the most outrageous things. He was definitely not the Jesus of the stained glass. In the author's winsome, narrative approach, he breaks Jesus out of the typical stereotypes, just as he set masculinity free in his book, Wild at Heart. By uncovering the real Jesus, readers are welcomed into the rich emotional life of Christ. All of the remarkable qualities of Jesus burst like fireworks with color and brilliance because of his humanity. Eldredge goes on to show readers how they can experience this Jesus in their lives every day. This book will quicken readers' worship, and deepen their intimacy with Jesus.	240	October 12th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12079560-beautiful-outlaw

The 13th Apostle		Raina C. Smith	4.43	14	3	{5: '9', 4: '3', 3: '1', 2: '1', 1: '0'}	Father Joseph is a devout priest with a sad but inspirational backstory living in Rome when he stumbles upon a well guarded ancient scroll shrouded in secrecy at the Vatican. It was written, he learns, over two thousand years ago by a man believed by a select few to have been a mysterious thirteenth apostle of Christ. When the disturbing prophecies of the scroll are revealed to Father Joseph he is certain the end of days for man is here and he is compelled to embark upon a journey around the world on a quest to save the soul of mankind. He is unaware that Glenn, an angel from the highest order of heaven, has already descended to earth to determine whether man has finally and completely emptied his soul of purity of heart of his own free will. If so, man's demise is imminent. Glenn's work is interrupted when the underworld sends Falene to place a well thought out, diabolical wager with the angel; find the last soul on earth with the purest of heart then turn him or her over to her to be tested. In no other way could the true resolve of mankind be measured. Glenn accepts the bet. If he loses, then all of humanity will be turned over to hell, the abode of the devils where the wicked dwell. When the chosen one is selected as the ultimate representative for all and stripped to his or her core and put to tests a hero would beg to be spared, can he or she rise up against evil in it's most intimidating form to prove that goodness still exists within the heart of mankind? The 13th Apostle begs readers to consider whether mankind is inherently good or evil and where they fall along that often very fine line.

Three thousand years of history and the myths of many cultures, as well as the fates of a dozen unforgettable characters, will all collide one hot summer in 1958; and the events played out on Buckeye Road will amount to nothing less than a new and life-affirming vision of the American Southwest...and of America itself.The vivid symbol of Buckeye Road is La Maravilla—the blanket of marigolds laid upon graves in Mexican cemeteries, and the mythical dog, sacred to the Aztecs, who returns from the under-world to lead his master to Mictlan, the land of the dead.

Kicker		R. Grey Hoover	3.97	145	21	{5: '66', 4: '36', 3: '25', 2: '9', 1: '9'}	"This is an alternate cover edition of isbn 9781477142. Based on actual experiences and official records from World War II, Kicker is a thrilling war novel of a man’s journey into hell. From the pleasant hills of Pennsylvania to the torrid jungles of Burma, Sam endures relentless enemy attacks against his unarmed aircraft while his family struggles with shortages and rationing at home. This is the tale of ""the forgotten front"", the bloody, grueling campaign to push the Japanese out of Burma.Although Kicker is an epic work of historical fiction, this World War 2 thriller is based on official military aviation history records and the real experiences of United States veterans who fought in the China-Burma-India Theater (CBI) ""the forgotten front"". Through unforgettable scenes in Burmese skies filled with monsoon storms and enemy fighter planes, Kicker tells the story of the brave Army Air Corps soldiers who risked their lives in unarmed aircraft to drop supplies to Merrill's Marauders and over 750,000 allied soldiers fighting in the perilous jungles of Burma.In effort to keep Japanese forces occupied in China, the Allies flew unarmed supply missions over the treacherous Himalayan Mountains between India and China. Their route, known as The Hump, saw the loss of over 1500 airmen and 2000 planes due to endless attacks by Japanese Zeros and some of the world's worst flying conditions. The Hump became known as ""the skyway to hell"" and ""the aluminum trail"" from the large amount of aircraft wreckage strewn across the Himalayan slopes.Allied soldiers in the jungles of Burma fought everyday just to survive. They faced elite, fearless Japanese soldiers and man-eating beasts. The Allies were surrounded by poisonous snakes, insects, and plants. These brave men suffered through monsoon seasons, so wet and humid, their uniforms rotted off their bodies as they fought fanatical Kamikaze armies through jungle and swamplands.From the Forgotten Front to the Homefront, Kicker brings you the story of America's Greatest Generation through the eyes of the men and women who would be forever haunted by their experiences.Reviews from fans of Kicker:""I could not put this book down, as the story of Sam, the young volunteer and aspiring pilot, unfolds. The author delivers his story telling with a rich back drop of historical details reflecting a thoroughly researched knowledge of the subject matter.""

The Vine Keeper . . .  messages in Poetry and Prose		William S. Peters Sr.	5.00	7	2	{5: '7', 4: '0', 3: '0', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	PrefaceOn the pages to come, awaits a journey as expressed through my verse. The words reflect an experiential-ness of my own and one that many of us at some level have had.The Vine Keeper is perhaps somewhat an “Egoic” examination of my inner self, my “Inner Child” and addresses many of the recurring questions and perhaps insights i may have had, or at least i thought i have had in my ‘Life Path’. Poetry for me as well as many others who i commune with tends to be the foundation of our Soul-felt reflections, our Emotions and the things we Think.One of my cherished quotes comes from the French Philosopher Descartes’ who coined the phrase ‘cogito ergo sum’ (i think therefore i am). Though many who read my work may defer in part or in its entirety from my perspectives, but what i must say is this . . . they are honest and therefore “Authentic” considerations of Creation, Life from most times a subjective point of view, and sometimes on rare occasions i touch on some things that may appear to be detached or quasi-objective.Throughout my life of wonder and discovery, my chief gripe perhaps would have been this. we are not taught to think creatively or independently of the machine. In The Vine Keeper i try. I hope, that this offering does justice to that dynamic which spawns you, the reader to look beyond the containment and remove the surreal lines in the Sand we think corral us.Blessed BeBillinner child	439	November 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16167541-the-vine-keeper-messages-in-poetry-and-prose

To save the lives of his closest friends he will have to risk the worst punishment his clan can inflict and must decide between the two females who challenge everything he believes in.	260	July 4th 2011	['Touches the Sky', 'Deneb Rising', 'Muddy River Mouth', 'Rain Ending', 'Fades Into Dusk', 'Wakes Softly']	['Ocean']	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12170410-dolphin-way

Ducey	4.36	11	3	{5: '7', 4: '3', 3: '0', 2: '0', 1: '1'}	Inspired by a true story, Stained Glass takes the reader on an epic journey from small-town Brazil in the 1970s to contemporary London as Lucas de Moraes struggles to escape a traumatic childhood and grasp the chance to build a new life as an artist in London. The novel opens with Lucas, now a successful abstract painter in London, putting aside his vibrant colours and involuntarily drawing a picture in charcoal of a little boy hiding under a clump of banana trees. With each drawing of the boy, Stained Glass returns to the Brazil of the 1970s, where the revered power of the Catholic Church looms over the poverty-stricken lives of its parishioners, and follows the boy’s tortuous path as he discovers the passion for line and colour that opens up a world of freedom. As drawing after drawing line the walls of his studio, Lucas experiences a union of self that ultimately releases him from the chains of his past.

Film as a Subversive Art		Amos Vogel	4.32	582	33	{5: '314', 4: '170', 3: '77', 2: '13', 1: '8'}	"A classic returns! The original edition of Amos Vogel's seminal book, ""Film as a Subversive Art"" was first published in 1974, and has been out of print since 1987. According to Vogel--founder of Cinema 16, North America's legendary film society--the book details the ""accelerating worldwide trend toward a more liberated cinema, in which subjects and forms hitherto considered unthinkable or forbidden are boldly explored."" So ahead of his time was Vogel that the ideas that he penned some 30 years ago are still relevant today, and readily accessible in this classic volume. Accompanied by over 300 rare film stills, ""Film as a Subversive Art"" analyzes how aesthetic, sexual and ideological subversives use one of the most powerful art forms of our day to exchange or manipulate our conscious and unconscious, demystify visual taboos, destroy dated cinematic forms, and undermine existing value systems and institutions. This subversion of form, as well as of content, is placed within the context of the contemporary world view of science, philosophy, and modern art, and is illuminated by a detailed examination of over 500 films, including many banned, rarely seen, or never released works."	336	1974			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/260290.Film_as_a_Subversive_Art

From the Ashes of Sobibor: A Story of Survival		['Thomas Toivi Blatt', 'Christopher R. Browning']	4.36	397	22	{5: '226', 4: '113', 3: '39', 2: '11', 1: '8'}	From the Ashes of Sobibor: A Story of Survival is an invaluable, firsthand account of a child's survival in a Nazi concentration camp in Poland during World War II. When the Germans invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, Thomas Toivi Blatt was twelve years old. He and his family lived in the largely Jewish town of Izbica in the Lublin district of Poland—the district that was to become the site of three major Nazi extermination camps: Belzec, Sobibor, and Majdanek. Blatt tells of the chilling events that led to his deportation to Sobibor, and of the six months he spent there before taking part in the now-famous uprising and mass breakout. Blatt's tale of escape, and of the five harrowing years spent eluding both the Nazis and anti-Semitic Polish nationalists, is gripping account of resilience and survival. This edition also includes the author's interview with Karl Frenzel, a former Nazi commandant at Sobibor.	242	June 25th 1997			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/520286.From_the_Ashes_of_Sobibor

Seven Sisters. The infamous collection of stars align with the full moon on Hallo’een, alighting the sky for a destiny that’s waited centuries. Dru, a gifted, but tormented witch living alone on the coast of Ireland wakes to find Ty, her long-time time love, mysteriously disappeared. In Paris, Katerina, an oppressed but talented dancer bravely takes the stage in one final performance before escaping a life of tyranny, looking for a freedom she’d only known in dreams. Aodh, The Dagda, a man made of ancient legends, has slumbered for two millennia. Tonight, when the moon is full and the stars are aligned, he rises from his temporary grave to find the world is not as he remembers. His people, his family, his tribe have vanquished, along with the majority of his considerable power. 	Chance takes him to Dru, and together they set out to find the key to reopening his world, whilst forming a bond of friendship neither has ever previously known. During their search, Dru learns Ty was no mortal man, but a god with a prophecy to fulfill. Ty died before fulfilling that prophecy, setting off a chain of events that would forever alter the future. Devastated, Dru abandons Aodh and the life that should have already been hers, and finds herself in the company of the worst sort. She begins a sordid affair with Kas, a daemon whose insatiable lust for power is only outdone by his lust for Dru. 	Separated from the only friend he knows, Aodh is left to search the world alone for answers. He meets the young and beautiful dancer, Katerina, and is instantly smitten with her grace and purity. He stays near her, pretending to be mortal, gaining her friendship. But on Katerina’s birthday, just as Aodh is ready to concede to a life of mortality, Katerina is ripped from him by Kas. Aodh’s ideas on remaining mortal are no more; he has to unlock the secrets to his world that will open a trove of unimaginable power to save the two women he loves, before time is no longer in his favour, and he loses everything."	401	October 31st 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7056921-tuatha-and-the-seven-sisters-moon

Deu-lhes, além do nome, uma biografia, um biotipo e, sobretudo, uma obra e um estilo poético únicos. Trata-se do único caso de heteronímia de toda história da literatura universal. Álvaro de Campos era, segundo Pessoa, 'o mais histericamente histérico de mim', era engenheiro, usava monóculo, e o poeta escrevia sob o seu nome quando sentia um súbito impulso de escrever não sei o quê. Campos é o heterônimo da modernidade, da euforia, da irreverência total a tudo e a todos, cultuador da liberdade, sedento por experimentar todas as sensações a um só tempo e profundamente influenciado por Walt Whitman. De sua lavra são os célebres versos de 'Opiário', 'Ode trinfual', 'Lisbon revisited' e 'Tabacaria' - este último considerado dos mais belos poemas da língua portuguesa.	336				https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8070004-poemas-de-lvaro-de-campos

Hollywood Hypocrites		Jason Mattera	3.75	202	33	{5: '55', 4: '69', 3: '57', 2: '14', 1: '7'}	From the New York Times bestselling author of Obama Zombies comes a sharp and humorous critique of the Hollywood left.THE BOOK YOU’RE ABOUT TO READ WILL PISS YOU OFF. Are you sick of self-important celebrities preaching against “global warming,” yet flying private planes to their countless homes? Fed up with lectures about charity and philanthropy from miserly rockers who will do anything for a tax break? Disgusted by leftist stars decrying the evils of the Second Amendment as their personal bodyguards pack more heat than a Chuck Norris kick to the face? The same Hollywood loons who got Barack Hussein Obama elected in 2008 will do so again in 2012. That is, unless we muzzle them. Four years ago, Republicans sat back like wimps and let Obama’s celebrity-fueled cool machine steamroll them into electoral smithereens. This time, we must do the steamrolling. New York Times bestselling author of Obama Zombies and gonzo journalist Jason Mattera takes the first stand with Hollywood Hypocrites, as he slays the Left’s sacred celebrity cows and teaches Obama’s Tinseltown foot soldiers their most important lesson yet: No longer can they attempt to deny Americans the very liberties they use to catapult themselves to prosperity and stardom. In his trademark eye-opening, no-holds-barred, and hilarious style, Mattera puts scores of A-list celebrities, including Sting, Madonna, Bono, Al Gore, Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon, Cameron Diaz, Bruce Springsteen, and many, many more under the microscope to analyze whether they live by the same environmental, health, anti-violence, civil rights, and other policy prescriptions they seek to inflict on Americans. What he uncovers will shock you. Hollywood’s megaphone is powerful, and the mainstream media’s love affair with the president will roar back with a vengeance when their guy is against the wall. Anyone who thinks Barack Obama’s abysmal first term will be enough to demoralize the Liberal Left Coast from flexing its mediated political muscle is a fool. It’s time to recognize the marketing and fund-raising power the Hollywood Progressives wield. It’s time to dig into the data and set the record straight. It’s time to turn the media spotlight back on the image makers and prevent the Hollywood elite from hoodwinking American voters once again.	272	March 13th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13260238-hollywood-hypocrites

Minster's a small town where making great grades, smiling pretty, helping old people, running the new-student Welcoming Committee, and putting up decorations for all the dances--including the totally awful Hot Shot fall hunting celebration--gets you ... what? Marty's not sure. Instead of dreaming about a sororities-and-frats future at nearby University of Michigan, she's restless, searching for a way out of the box her controlling mother and best frenemy Sarah have locked her in. When Lil--don't call her Lily!--Hatfield transfers to Minster, Marty gets her chance. Lil's different. She smokes, wears black, listens to angry punk records, and lives in a weird trailer with her mother. Lil has secrets--secrets that make her a target for all the gossiping and online bullying Minster can muster. But so does Marty. And Marty sees something different in Lil. Something honest. Something real. PLAYING NICE is the achingly true story of a girl who's been following the rules for so long she's forgotten who she was when she started. It's about falling in love with the wrong people and not seeing the right ones, about the moments in life when you step out of line, take a chance ... and begin to break free."

Counterfeit Gods: The Empty Promises of Money, Sex, and Power, and the Only Hope That Matters		Timothy J. Keller	4.34	13866	739	{5: '7425', 4: '4471', 3: '1432', 2: '328', 1: '210'}	The New York Times bestselling author of The Reason for God and The Prodigal God and a nationally renowned minister, Timothy Keller exposes the error of making good things ultimate in his latest book, and shows readers a new path toward a hope that lasts. Success, true love, and the life you've always wanted. Many of us placed our faith in these things, believing they held the key to happiness, but with a sneaking suspicion they might not deliver. The recent economic meltdown has cast a harsh new light on these pursuits. In a matter of months, fortunes, marriages, careers, and a secure retirement have disappeared for millions of people. No wonder so many of us feel lost, alone, disenchanted, and resentful. But the truth is that we made lesser gods of these good things -gods that can't give us what we really need. There is only one God who can wholly satisfy our cravings- and now is the perfect time to meet him again, or for the first time.  The Bible tells us that the human heart is an idol- factory, taking good things and making them into idols that drive us. In Counterfeit Gods, Keller applies his trademark approach to show us how a proper understanding of the Bible reveals the unvarnished truth about societal ideals and our own hearts. This powerful message will cement Keller's reputation as a critical thinker and pastor, and comes at a crucial time-for both the faithful and the skeptical.	240	October 20th 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6403690-counterfeit-gods

Stillpoint: A Novel of War and Peace		Colin D. Mallard	4.11	47	21	{5: '24', 4: '13', 3: '5', 2: '1', 1: '4'}	Stillpoint is an emotional and intellectual adventure, that keeps one reading into the wee hours. The reader is immediately drawn into the story and thus begins an unforgettable ride into other worlds, other possibilities.Stillpoint will make you think, make you examine what lies at the root of your beliefs. Some books shift the way we see the world, even ourselves. This is one of them!Mallard asks: Why are the Palestinians and Israelis still fighting after almost seventy years, what can we do about it, you and me?He suggests we become aware of the facts hidden behind the beliefs and ideology. You’ll not finish this novel in the same place you started. To see with someone else’s eyes brings understanding and understanding itself opens the door to peace.It would be misleading to leave the impression this book is solely about the Middle East. Although a great deal of the story takes place there, it is in fact, a deep exploration of justice and injustice in the perpetuation of conflict. It is about war and peace, poverty and wealth, leadership and service, and what lies behind the fiery violence of religious fundamentalism.What is unusual about the book is that Mallard approaches events from the perspective of the practical wisdom and insight inherent in Zen, Taoism and Advaita Vedanta.In Stillpoint he has fashioned a love story to the great mystery of life, it is definitely a novel worth reading…more than once. A great story with a stunning conclusion.	425	November 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18516108-stillpoint

Hansen	3.98	298	71	{5: '115', 4: '111', 3: '39', 2: '17', 1: '16'}	To trust is to get hurt, to be loved could end in death.Everyone sees Ash as the toughest of the Rata brothers, the tall, tattooed man who is untouchable. But not many know of his past, of a tormented youth, which almost saw him take his own life. For ten years he's lived with the nightmares of his stepfather raping him, and how it destroyed his family. Further tormented by his first love leaving him, he tries to move forward with his new partner Beth, but is unable to open up to her, his past continuing to eat away at his soul.Beth knows Ash is keeping her in the dark, and every word he doesn't say, every secret he keeps, pushes her further into his brother's arms, someone who doesn't understand boundaries, a trait that has given Dante a wild reputation: the man every woman wants to bed. Hedonistic and uncontrollable, Dante desires Beth to the point of madness, his bipolar condition worsening with the stress of his hidden desires. He wants to control her, to take her, but he is deeply reliant on Ash, and like his brother, he hides his true nature. On the outside he shows a confident swagger that gets him the attention of both sexes, but on the inside all he wants is one woman who sees him as more than a sexual object.Sledge, the youngest of the three Rata brothers, finds himself in a different situation, dealing with the affections of his best friend: Beth's brother Corey. Diagnosed with cancer, Corey wants Sledge more than life itself, even though he believes Sledge is homophobic and would find him disgusting if he confessed his love. But when another man shows interest in Corey, Sledge's jealousy eats away at him, and makes him reassess his sexuality, and whether he could be more than a friend to Corey - whether he could be his lover.As the Rata family's love life is thrown into tangles, the brothers' stepfather escapes from prison with one thing on his mind: To get Ash once again. Someone he will kill for - and has killed for.(R18)Author's Note: Book 2 has different main characters from book 1. Due to this, you don't need to read book 1 to understand this story. Book 2 is more dark romance and family drama, while book one is street lit and social realism.

Eating acid like it was candy and chasing speed with cheap vodka, smoking truckloads of weed, all in a vain attempt to get numb and stay numb.This is the story of a young man and a generation of angry youths who rebelled against their parents and the unfulfilled promise of the sixties. As with many self-destructive kids, Noah Levine's search for meaning led him first to punk rock, drugs, drinking, and dissatisfaction. But the search didn't end there. Having clearly seen the uselessness of drugs and violence, Noah looked for positive ways to channel his rebellion against what he saw as the lies of society. Fueled by his anger at so much injustice and suffering, Levine now uses that energy and the practice of Buddhism to awaken his natural wisdom and compassion.While Levine comes to embrace the same spiritual tradition as his father, bestselling author Stephen Levine, he finds his most authentic expression in connecting the seemingly opposed worlds of punk and Buddhism. As Noah Levine delved deeper into Buddhism, he chose not to reject the punk scene, instead integrating the two worlds as a catalyst for transformation. Ultimately, this is an inspiring story about maturing, and how a hostile and lost generation is finally finding its footing. This provocative report takes us deep inside the punk scene and moves from anger, rebellion, and self-destruction, to health, service to others, and genuine spiritual growth.	272	May 4th 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128116.Dharma_Punx

Killing the Messenger: A Story of Radical Faith, Racism's Backlash, and the Assassination of a Journalist		Thomas Peele	4.05	167	32	{5: '56', 4: '72', 3: '34', 2: '2', 1: '3'}	When a nineteen-year-old member of a Black Muslim cult assassinated Oakland newspaper editor Chauncey Bailey in 2007—the most shocking killing of a journalist in the United States in thirty years—the question was, Why? “I just wanted to be a good soldier, a strong soldier,” the killer told police.   A strong soldier for whom?Killing the Messenger is a searing work of narrative nonfiction that explores one of the most blatant attacks on the First Amendment and free speech in American history and the small Black Muslim cult that carried it out. Award-winning investigative reporter Thomas Peele examines the Black Muslim movement from its founding in the early twentieth century by a con man who claimed to be God, to the height of power of the movement’s leading figure, Elijah Muhammad, to how the great-grandson of Texas slaves reinvented himself as a Muslim leader in Oakland and built the violent cult that the young gunman eventually joined. Peele delves into how charlatans exploited poor African Americans with tales from a religion they falsely claimed was Islam and the years of bloodshed that followed, from a human sacrifice in Detroit to police shootings of unarmed Muslims to the horrible backlash of racism known as the “zebra murders,” and finally to the brazen killing of Chauncey Bailey to stop him from publishing a newspaper story.   Peele establishes direct lines between the violent Black Muslim organization run by Yusuf Bey in Oakland and the evangelicalism of the early prophets and messengers of the Nation of Islam.  Exposing the roots of the faith, Peele examines its forerunner, the Moorish Science Temple of America, which in the 1920s and ’30s preached to migrants from the South living in Chicago and Detroit ghettos that blacks were the world’s master race, tricked into slavery by white devils. In spite of the fantastical claims and hatred at its core, the Nation of Islam was able to build a following by appealing to the lack of identity common in slave descendants.  In Oakland, Yusuf Bey built a cult through a business called Your Black Muslim Bakery, beating and raping dozens of women he claimed were his wives and fathering more than forty children.  Yet, Bey remained a prominent fixture in the community, and police looked the other way as his violent soldiers ruled the streets. An enthralling narrative that combines a rich historical account with gritty urban reporting, Killing the Messenger is a mesmerizing story of how swindlers and con men abused the tragedy of racism and created a radical religion of bloodshed and fear that culminated in a journalist’s murder.THOMAS PEELE is a digital investigative reporter for the Bay Area News Group and the Chauncey Bailey Project. He is also a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, Graduate School of Journalism.  His many honors include the Investigative Reporters and Editors Tom Renner Award for his reporting on organized crime, and the McGill Medal for Journalistic Courage.

A chance discovery leads Kailey to a meeting with elderly Gunthreon, actual master of persuasion. Gunthreon, who seems to know too much of Kailey's history for her liking, opens Kailey's eyes to a coexisting realm she never knew existed: Renhala, while entrusting her with the knowledge of her newfound power as karmelean, serving as a beacon to the Higher Ones. Kailey slowly starts revealing new talents, and Gunthreon is fascinated with what she starts achieving.She soon discovers that Renhala is in danger, and this danger has been leaking into her own realm. As she uncovers secrets within herself, and attempts to toughen up, she fuses with an unlikely band of fellow travelers (including a dragon, woodsprite, six-hundred-pound greble, her faithful female canine companion, and a ""giver""), falls into an unexpected love triangle, deals with her sexy and flirtatious best friend’s “issues,” and finds the courage to master a new deadly weapon. On her mission to save Renhala, Kailey will find herself running from life-threatening disasters, such as greble Tartarin, who likes to remind Kailey that when he catches her, he plans on eating her brains with ice cream; she'll run from the deadly meeples: small cute bunnies with talons and an undeniable thirst for imposing self-destruction on others. Kailey will also run into the possibility that a centuries-old Renhalan rumor is true, that advanced technology existing in Kailey's realm shortens all life spans.As blood is shed and puzzles near completion, Kailey pulls from deep within herself, conjuring up mystical qualities that enable her to astonish as once predicted at her birth, but despite the newfound strength, Kailey will discover that monsters not only come in ugly packages, but can be easily disguised as those she has come to love and trust."	406	September 27th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18177486-renhala

Un pomeriggio d'estate lei lo lascia, dicendogli che ""le piacciono gli amori infelici"". Si ritrovano molti anni dopo, decidono di sposarsi: sono allegri, innamorati, sembrano felici. Arno è convinto di darle tutto se stesso e non si spiega le malinconie e le bugie che affiorano poco a poco. In fondo, la sua vita gli piace così com'è: suona il violoncello alla Scala, ha avuto tre figli dalla donna della sua vita, non si fa domande. Ma il disagio di Sara col tempo aumenta, finché una mattina Arno non sarà costretto da un evento inconcepibile a chiedersi chi è davvero la persona con cui ha vissuto tredici anni, la donna che ama da sempre. Con titubanza, inizia a seguire una pista di ferite giovanili e passioni soffocate e, con crescente sgomento, ritrova il bandolo di storie insospettabili.Può una donna restare con un uomo che pensa di amarla ma non ha mai voluto conoscerla davvero? Può un uomo accettare che sua moglie non si fidi di lui? Si può vivere senza esprimere se stessi? E come incide il dolore nelle nostre vite? Abbiamo tutti le stesse carte in mano?Costruito secondo la vertiginosa spirale di una fuga, L'acustica perfetta ha la delicatezza di un romanzo di formazione - la formazione di un uomo adulto, di un amore - e la rapinosa potenza di un romanzo d'indagine.Daria Bignardi dà voce a uno straordinario protagonista maschile, attraverso le cui parole si compone, tassello dopo tassello, il ritratto di una donna inquieta e vibrante. Un percorso verso la verità che si cela al fondo di ogni relazione, verso il cuore buio che ciascuno di noi protegge anche dalle persone amate, un viaggio nel profondo, dentro i silenzi e i segreti delle nostre vite. Fino all'imprevedibile finale."	204	October 30th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16112067-l-acustica-perfetta

Instead I got a glimpse of the wiring beneath the board, a tantalizing vision of the true nature of reality, where mind really can rule over matter but paranoia can drag your worst nightmares kicking and screaming into reality. All I did was ask for a sign. But that sign would not be revealed to me wholesale, no, I had to earn it by solving the riddle that surrounded my wishes. A riddle as old as the ancient systems of the Occult, reflected in the Tarot and the glowing red digits of my alarm clock. A riddle that, once understood, would change everything. Forever. Drawing inspiration from actual events, this is the story of a young man's struggle to survive a dark underworld of crime whilst wrestling with the mysteries of the Universe. An artfully crafted synthesis of the authenticity and humour of Trainspotting and the puzzle solving epiphanies of The Da Vinci Code.	190	February 22nd 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17455034-sign-of-the-time

I have been raised during the oppressive Soviet regime and fortunate enough to leave it behind. This political memoir is my contribution to show people the contrast between what I have experienced and what we are experiencing in the United States currently. AfterTastes and Tales from Russia (Forgive me for being anti Social...ism) is part memoirs, part political analysis and opinions. The point I try to make is simple, that socialism has never worked and I provide my childhood memories, experiences and analysis on why. AfterTastes and Tales from Russia is a book that will reach out to the people of all political spectrum and race. I provide examples on how the non-religious, atheist society may still be very prejudiced and, in fact, more prejudiced than a free society.

For family, even the girls' own father, it was a constant guessing game. For strangers, the surprise was overwhelming. And for the twins Olivia and Victoria Henderson, two remarkable young women coming of age at the turn of the century, their bond was mysterious, marvelous, and often playful—a secret realm only they inhabited.Olivia and Victoria were the beloved daughters of a man who never fully recovered from his wife's death bearing them in 1893. Shy, serious Olivia, born eleven minutes before her sister, had taken over the role of mother in their lush New York estate, managing not only a household but her rebellious twin's flights of fancy. Free-spirited Victoria wanted to change the world. She embraced the women's suffrage movement and dreamed of sailing to war-torn Europe. Then, in the girls' twenty-first year, as the first world war escalated overseas, a fateful choice changed their lives forever.It began when Victoria's life was about to become a public scandal. It led to a painful decision, and brought handsome lawyer Charles Dawson into the Henderson's life and family. Hand-picked by the twins' father to save his daughter's reputation, Charles was still mourning his wife's death aboard the Titanic, struggling to raise his nine year-old son alone, determined never to lose his heart again. Charles wanted to believe that, for the sake of his son, he could make an unwanted marriage work. But in an act of deception that only Olivia and Victoria could manage, the twins took an irrevocable step, which changed both their lives forever; and took one of the twins to the battlefields of France, the other into a marriage she longed for but could not have.From Manhattan society to the trenches of war-ravaged France, Mirror Image moves elegantly and dramatically through a rich and troubled era. With startling insight, Danielle Steel explores women's choices: between home and adventure, between the love for family and the passion for a cause, between sacrifice and desire. But at the heart of Mirror Image is a fascinating, realistic portrait of identical twins, two vastly different sisters who lead their lives and follow their destinies against a vivid backdrop of a world at war.From the Hardcover edition.	576	May 29th 2007	['Olivia Henderson', 'Victoria Henderson', 'Charles Dawson']	['New York City, New York']	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/390374.Mirror_Image

Furthermore, both argument and style embody the Enlightenment values of rationality, lucidity and order to which Gibbon so passionately subscribed and to which his HISTORY is such a magnificent monument.	1952	October 26th 1993			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/672484.The_Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire
Six of One	Runnymede #1	Rita Mae Brown	4.09	2204	117	{5: '904', 4: '757', 3: '423', 2: '85', 1: '35'}	Perched right on the Mason-Dixon line, tiny Runnymede, Maryland, is ripe with a history almost as colorful as the women who live there—from Celeste Chalfonte, headstrong and aristocratic, who murders for principle and steals her brother’s wife, to Fannie Jump Creighton, who runs a speakeasy right in her own home when hard times come knocking. Then of course, there’re Louise and Julia, the boldly eccentric Hunsenmeir sisters. Wheezie and Juts spend their whole lives in Runnymede, cheerfully quibbling about everything from men to child-rearing to how to drive a car. But they never let small-town life keep them from chasing their biggest dreams—or from being true to who they really are. Sparkling with a perfect combination of sisterhood and sass, Six of One is a richly textured Southern canvas—Rita Mae Brown “at her winning, fondest best”(Kirkus Reviews).	368	July 6th 1999		['Maryland']	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/165185.Six_of_One

Da questo episodio epocale per la memoria della piccola comunità, si diparte il lungo racconto di Zayde, il protagonista - ragazzino e poi uomo - che accompagna il lettore in un suggestivo viaggio sul filo dei ricordi. Al centro della storia è Yehudit, madre di Zayde, una donna forte e indipendente, custode di una sofferenza viscerale e di un lacerante segreto. Tre figure maschili si alternano sulla scena: sono gli uomini, diversissimi tra loro, che si contendono l'amore di Yehudit e la paternità di Zayde, occupandosene generosamente a modo proprio e secondo i propri mezzi. Mescolando voci ed episodi, passato e presente, Zayde ricrea una fitta trama di rapporti personali, di fatti che si intersecano per arrivare a ricostruire un mosaico esistenziale collettivo al cui centro campeggia il mistero di Yehudit, sfuggente e inarrivabile. Dominata dall'idea di un destino ineluttabile che grava su tutti ""smisurato e indifferente"", la narrazione procede secondo un ritmo pacato, scandito dai suoni, dai profumi - indimenticabili quelli delle prelibate cene che Yaakov, uno dei padri, prepara a Zayde - e dagli eventi di un microcosmo rurale che assurge a emblema universale."	409	2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/250180.Four_Meals
Spiritus Mundi	Spiritus Mundi #1	Robert   Sheppard	4.00	14	4	{5: '7', 4: '4', 3: '1', 2: '0', 1: '2'}	"Spiritus Mundi by Robert Sheppard, nominated for the prestigious 2014 Pushcart Prize for Literature, consists of Spiritus Mundi, the Novel—Book I, and Spiritus Mundi, the Romance—Book II. Book I’s espionage-terror-political-religious thriller-action criss-crosses the globe from Beijing to London to Washington, Mexico City and Jerusalem presenting a vast panorama of the contemporary international world, including compelling action, deep and realistic characters and surreal adventures, while Book II dialates the setting and scope into a fantasy (though still rooted in the real) adventure where the protagonists embark on a quest to the realms of Middle Earth and its Crystal Bead Game and through a wormhole to the Council of the Immortals in the Amphitheater in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy in search of the crucial Silmaril Crystal, and to plead for the continuance of the human race in the face of threatened extinction from a nuclear World War III, all followed by a triple-somersault thriller ending in which a common garden-variety terrorist attack is first uncovered by MI6 and the CIA as the opening gambit a Greatpower Game of States threatening World War III and then, incredibly, as the nexus of a Time Travel conspiracy involving an attempt by fascist forces of the 23rd Century to alter a benign World History by a time-travelling raid on their past and our present to provoke that World War III, foiled by the heroic efforts of the democratic 23rd Century world government, the Senate of the United States of Earth, to hunt down the fascist interlopers before their history is irrevocably altered for evil. When activist Robert Sartorius, leading a global campaign to create a European Parliament-style world-wide United Nations Parliamentary Assembly presses the proposal in New York on his old friend the UN Secretary-General and is rebuffed due to the hostile pressure of the conservative American administration, his Committee resolves to fight back by launching a celebrity-driven Bono-Geldof-Band Aid/Live 8-style “People Power” media campaign and telethon spearheaded by rock superstars Isis and Osiris and former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to mobilize global public support and pressure in alliance with the Occupy Wall Street Movements worldwide. The Blogs of Sartorius, activist Eva Strong and Committee Chairman Andreas Sarkozy reveal the campaign’s working struggle, their tangled love affairs, a loss of faith, attempted suicide, reconciliation of father and son after divorce, and recovery of personal love and faith. Things fall apart as the idealists’ global crusade is infiltrated by a cell of jihadist terrorists using it as a cover, then counter-infiltrated by CIA agent Jack McKinsey and British MI6 agent Etienne Dearlove. A cat-and-mouse game of espionage and intrigue ensues pitting them against the Chinese MSS espionage network allied with the Iranian Quds Force crossing Beijing, London, Moscow, Washington and Jerusalem unleashing an uncontrollable series of events which sees the American Olympic Track and Field Team bombed on an airplane in London, uncovers a secret conspiracy of China, Russia and Iran to jointly seize the oil reserves of the Middle-East, and witnesses Presidents Clinton and Carter taken hostage with Sartorius, McKinsey, Eva and other activists at a Jerusalem telethon rally cut short by the explosion of a concealed atomic device in a loaned Chinese Terracotta Warrior, then flown by capturing terrorists to Qom, Iran as “human shields” to deter a retaliatory nuclear attack.In Book II, Spiritus Mundi, the Romance they encounter Iran’s Supreme Leader in Qom as the world teeters on the brink of nuclear confrontation and World War III, while mysterious events unfold leading Sartorius and McKinsey from their captivity in the underground nuclear facilities of Qom into a hidden neo-mythic dimension that takes them to a vast ocean and land at the center of the world, Middle Earth, Inner Shambhala, and to involvement in a mysterious Castalian “Crystal Bead Game” linked to the destiny of the human race on earth. They then embark on a quest for the Silmaril, or Missing Seed Crystal to the central island of Omphalos in the Great Central Sea in the middle of the globe, aided by Goethe, the Chinese Monkey King, Captain Nemo, the African God-Hero Ogun, and a Sufi mystic they traverse a ‘wormhole’ at the center of the earth guarded by ‘The Mothers’ and the fallen angel tribe of the Grigori (Genesis 6:1-4) which leads the way to critical meeting of the “Council of the Immortals” at the Black Hole in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy to determine the final fate of the human species. The heroes battle and overcome the treacherous opposition of Mephisto and his satanic subaltern Mundus through their Underworld and Otherworld adventures and successfully plead the cause of the continuation of the human species before the Immortals, returning with the critical Silmaril Crystal, resolving the Crystal Bead Game and thereby inspiring through the Archangel Gabriel a dream in the mind of Iran’s Supreme Leader which brings a new Revelation causing him to release the hostages and an end the crisis. China and Russia stand down from aiding Iran in seizing the Mid-East oil reserves, but in a treacherous blow the Chinese instead utilize their forward-positioned armies to attack their former ally Russia and seize Siberia with its large oil and gas reserves instead. President Barret Osama, America’s newly-elected first black President then invites Russia, Japan and South Korea to join NATO and together they succeed in expelling the Chinese from Siberia and usher in a new Eurasian and global balance of power and a New World Order.Rock Superstar Osiris meanwhile, after undertaking a narcissistic Messianic mission in the wake of the Jerusalem atomic blast is dramatically assassinated on live world-wide television on Jerusalem’s Via Dolorosa by a disillusioned follower. His wife and rock-star partner Isis then leads a spiritual movement to reconcile and unite the clashing religions and catalyze a common global spiritual Renaissance through a Global Progressive Spiritual Alliance which seeks to construct an Inter-faith Temple on the ruins of the atomic blast in Jerusalem. In counter-reaction to the cataclysmic events the world finally implements Sartorius’ crusade for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, but not before Sartorius has himself has died, Moses-like of a heart attack while helping to foil a metaconspiracy mediated by Time Travel in which a fascist agent from the 23rd Century who has time-transited back to our time to alter a benign history by causing WWIII and thus preventing the evolution of a democratic world government, the United States of Earth, which follows him through time and nabs him just in the “nick of time” to prevent Aramgeddon. The book ends with the opening ceremony of the UN Parliamentary Assembly which is attended in Sartorius’ name by his widow Eva Strong, whom Sartorius had fallen in love with and married in the course of the novel, and by their son Euphy, newborn after Sartorius’ death. They are joined in cinematic climax at the ceremony by newly chosen UN Secretary-General Clinton, President Osama and UN Parliamentary Assembly Committee Chairman Andreas Sarkozy who have just received the Nobel Peace Prize for their work in creation of the world’s first world parliamentary assembly within the United Nations, bringing together the representative voices of the peoples of the world in face-to-face assembly and dialogue for the first time in world history.

Voodoo in My Blood: A Healer's Journey from Surgeon to Shaman		Carolle Jean-Murat	4.25	16	4	{5: '8', 4: '4', 3: '4', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	Born and raised in Haiti to a family of healers, Dr. Carolle Jean-Murat completed her medical training in the US and settled in San Diego in 1982. She soon was regarded as one of the best gynecologic surgeons around-tall and regal, a lone black female among the elite. But her success harbored a secret: when a patient entered her office, Dr. Jean-Murat could quickly and intuitively see the root cause of her patient's illness, often times knowing she could help the patient without having to put her under the knife. Carolle knew she dare not make these claims aloud. Struggling to fit in with the Western medical paradigm, her intuition and vision were best left unmentioned.Harboring secrets wasn't new to Carolle, who grew up in Papa Doc Duvalier's Haiti where the threat of being snatched by the Tontons Macoutes was a daily fear. Her own father, after being tortured, miraculously escaped death and was forced to leave the country in the middle of the night, ending up as an illegal immigrant in New York City.In Carolle's society, everything had a dire price-including admitting openly to the practice of voodoo. This, too, would shape her life. A mere four-year old, Carolle was taken from her family home, and sent to live with her paternal grandmother and aunt because her own mother was a voodoo practitioner. Nevertheless, fate would find a way of returning Carolle to her.As a teenager Carolle became gravely ill; even the doctors had given up on her. With no other recourse, she was taken to her maternal grandfather where she stayed in his healing room in his voodoo temple. There, he and Carolle's mother exposed her to voodoo healing, mixing a potent potion she had to drink. They proclaimed her healed- and indeed, she was. Though she returned to live with her paternal grandmother, where once again she was told to never tell that she had been exposed to voodoo, her mother and grandfather had told her differently: 'You can run, but you can't hide from what you know. Voodoo, is in your blood.' Thus began Carolle's hidden and tumultuous relationship with this African-based paradigm of healing.For years Carolle struggled inwardly to reconcile her family's healing heritage; even outwardly she was forced to pass up many opportunities, in order to keep her family a secret. Once immersed in Western medical practice, Carolle constantly struggled with bringing her intuition to the forefront-healing through the spirit and not just the surgeon's knife.

Can a cheating father, a stiff, cold mother, a pissed-off BFF, and a (thankfully!) loving aunt with adopted girls of her own help Evelyn make the heart-wrenching decisions that follow?	310	February 26th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12439950-me-him-them-and-it

Tara de sub fluturi		Dragos Voicu	4.63	8	1	{5: '5', 4: '3', 3: '0', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	"The book could thrill all the readers aware by the economical and moral crisis we face. It is a dystopia where a country in economical crisis cannot function anymore and the government decides to sell it to a consortium of countries. The population loses the houses due to mortgages and the government decides to allocate tents installed in the parks to accommodate the desperate families. The life in such conditions is described and a story of a family living in such conditions is developed. Finally the country is sold and the consortium decides to organize the country as a collector of the sewages, wastage and garbage coming from the rest of the continent’s countries. There is an important political person in the book, who decides to cover all this abjectness with huge colored and perfumed butterflies…The book is a mirror over a world in distress…-----------------------------------------------Andreea Toma (http://andreeaiuliatoma.blogspot.com/... ):""Debutul lui Dragos Voicu a avut loc in 2009 cu romanul Coada, aparut la Editura Cartea Romaneasca, si care a primit Premiul pentru Proza la Concursul de debut organizat de aceasta editura. Nu am avut ocazia de a-l citi, in schimb am avut prilejul de a citi acest al doilea roman al sau-Tara de sub fluturi, care si-a facut aparitia de cateva luni in peisajul literaturii noastre contemporane. O gura de aer proaspat prinde bine din cand in cand, si astfel mi s-a parut mie ceea ce am gasit intre paginile acestei carti. A fost ceva diferit de lecturile mele de pana acum, ineditul imbracand felurite forme. Incepand cu titlul si continuand, treptat, cu fiecare pagina, am descoperit o lume invaluita in metafore. Din primele randuri ai senzatia ca vei citi ceva de domeniul fantasticului grotesc, fenomene incredibile au loc- oamenii si animalele isi pierd parul, pasarile au ramas fara pene-, si, daca as fi judecat doar dupa acest tablou initial, probabil ca nu as fi fost atrasa de subiectul cartii. Insa mi-am coborat privirea rand dupa rand si am simtit ca voi avea surprize placute. Nu m-am inselat.In Tara de sub fluturi gasim o lume supusa degradarii, primele imagini sunt apasatoare, sufocante, incepi sa simti caldura coplesitoare ce a cuprins tara, o senzatie de dezintegrare treptata parca bantuie printre oamenii tot mai obositi de traiul lor. Oameni evacuate de catre banci din casele lor si nevoiti sa locuiasca in parcuri, in corturile pe care Statul cel grijuliu cu cetatenii sai le-a pus la dispozitie. O imagine dezolanta, contracarata de un pasaj ce m-a amuzat de-a binelea: reprezentantii bancilor continua sa le faca oferte de creditare numeroaselor victime ale creditelor anterioare, oferte care de care mai pompoase, acoperind tot felul de situatii, culminand cu perspectiva decesului potentialului client, ce va muri in contul bancii, nu in al sau.Treptat, lumea din Tara de sub fluturi capata contururi atat de familiare, incat caracterul alegoric incepe sa ne scape, lucrurile ce se petrec nu ni se mai par atat de incredibile, ci ne infatiseaza o posibila realitate viitoare, nu atat de indepartata pe cat ne-ar place sa credem. Imaginile adesea halucinante dobandesc conotatii reale. Situatiile aducatoare de zambete pe chipul cititorului sunt presarate cu maiestrie in tot cuprinsul romanului. Senzatia ce m-a insotit permanent pe parcursul lecturii a fost aceea ca un ochi rade si altul plange. O parte din mine era incantata de umorul nascut de anumite intamplari, iar cealalta se infiora de perspectiva sumbra aruncata asupra viitorului. Caci in pofida aerului alegoric, intesat de imagini aparent exagerate, bogate in semnificatii, locurile si oamenii, trasaturile lor, sunt atat de usor de recunoscut, incat nu mai simti nevoia ca ele sa poarte un nume. Totul se desfasoara sub auspiciile nefaste ale Crizei, cu majuscula, asa cum apare si in carte. Personajul principal, un personaj-narator, fara nume si el, este un ins ca oricare altul dintre cei multi, afectati din plin de Criza. Dar prin prisma locului de munca pe care inca are norocul sa il detina- este un mic functionar la Ministerul Aerului-, are prilejul sa asiste fara sa poata face ceva la toate manevrele, la jocurile de culise ale inaltilor demnitari, care invart pe degete destinele a milioane de oameni si, impreuna cu ei, al unei intregi tari. Avem in fata o satira a tuturor tarelor societatii, pe care le cunoastem si le recunoastem, ele nu sunt deloc putine, la fiecare pas este ilustrata una din ele. Incepand cu prostia in materie de vot, continuand cu pasiunea pentru mancatul semintelor, cu festinele electorale, cu demagogia politicienilor, cu coruptia intalnita la toate nivelele, de la cel mai marunt pana la cel mai inalt sau invers, apoi cu dezinteresul pentru binele tarii si interesul exclusiv pentru propriul profit. Si daca la un moment dat am fost uimita de episodul vanzarii aerului curat din munti catre tari afectate de poluare masiva, ulterior aveam sa am un moment de stupoare- o decizie radicala luata de mai marii tarii, ca unica solutie de iesire din criza, si care implica o groaza de alte masuri extreme de costisitoare, inutile, in detrimentul altora cu adevarat eficiente, demonstrandu-le inventivitatea netarmurita in aceasta privinta. Toate acestea va par cunoscute, nu? Doar ca in acest roman ele capata dimensiuni noi, frizand incredibilul. Un incredibil, cum spuneam, perfect posibil. N-ai cum sa nu te gandesti, citind paginile a caror intensitate creste gradual, ca multitudinea de elemente deghizate in metafore sunt de fapt nu doar detalii dintr-un posibil drum pe care lumea de langa noi l-ar putea urma, ci chiar ceea ce se petrece acum sub ochii nostri. Pagini impresionante pentru mine au fost si cele care lasa oarecum la o parte meschinaria politica, evocandu-i pe bunicii personajului-narator. Franturi din trecutul mai recent sau mai indepartat si culminand cu degradarea prezentului, in care bunica, ramasa vaduva de cativa ani, isi asteapta sfarsitul intr-o saracie lucie, in satul si el degradat, in care putinii oameni ramasi s-au transformat in indivizi josnici, betivi si hoti. M-au emotionat profund paginile acestea. Bogatia stilistica ce caracterizeaza intreg textul este presarata la momentele potrivite cu unele expresii ce ar putea parea vulgare, insa nu sunt folosite pentru a face deliciul unui public dornic de limbaj licentios, ci se aseaza firesc in discursurile anumitor personaje, ca parte integranta din felul lor de-a fi, ca o nota de autenticitate.Si ar mai fi multe de comentat pe marginea cartii, insa n-as vrea sa dezvalui prea mult din continutul sau, sa nu va stric surpriza lecturii. Este o carte surprinzatoare, bine construita, scrisa intr-un stil fluid, placut. As putea spune chiar ca are si o doza de lirism fin impletita in tesatura elaborata a frazelor. Sper ca nu am fost prea lunga de vorba in exprimarea entuziasmului meu, dar de cate ori am ocazia sa citesc o astfel de carte, care produce valuri in constiinta mea de cititor, ma simt datoare sa-mi impartasesc impresiile cu voi. Cartea a aparut la Editura A.T.U. din Sibiu si poate fi comandata de aici. Pretul este foarte accesibil si fiti convinsi ca merita fiecare leu.

Our Virtuous Republic: The Forgotten Clause in the American Social Contract		Richard D. Baris	5.00	3	1		"Is it no longer a ""self-evident"" truth that government's nature is to become tyrannical? ""Our Virtuous Republic"" is the book the establishment does not want Americans on the right, left, or center to read. The argument is a vociferous and comprehensive defense of American traditionalism, a lesson in American citizenship, and a call for a return to civil society. Conservatives academics and politicians have failed to make a decisive argument for our founding principles. As a result, the progressive narrative has attached an unsubstantiated backward stigma to the ideals born of the American mainstream Protestant ethic, such as civic duty, obligation and other elements of American traditionalism that are necessary for a healthy society. Baris uses psychology, logic, economics, history, and science to deconstruct the progressive argument to its regressive core. Breaking through the superficial, he explains how our human nature interacts with the different elements of each political philosophy in American politics. The evidence, in total, points to one conclusion. There is a Natural Law that illuminates the path to human happiness and well-being. Our Founding Fathers designed the American social contract in accordance with Natural Law to ensure that we would all have the opportunity to achieve the highest state of being. Honoring the terms of that social contract is the true path to progress."	146	May 16th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17974854-our-virtuous-republic

It tells of a passion of such profound intensity that, perhaps, no-one has ever felt as deeply.Valentine is a young man, quite content with his life, until, one day, he meets a girl, by chance, who completely upends his world.Karina is a young virginal student from Peru, living in London, for reasons unknown. With just one glance of her strange Incan beauty, Valentine is bewitched. From that moment on, his every thought is of her, his every feeling, his every dream. He is completely overwhelmed by an unaccountably powerful love. Yet, Karina is a mystery. Everything about her is elusive. Valentine is led on a mystery of the Heart, to discover the truth of the one he has come to love, so unexpectedly.Why is she so mysterious? What is the truth of her life? How can he love someone who seems so indefinable?They share a mutual uncontrollable passion – indeed, neither has known feelings so irresistible in their lives. Yet, always, there is the presence of the shadow of the unknown.This is the true story of a great love. Valentine spent six years, at night, alone in a room, writing this book, after the last day he ever saw Karina.

From her comfortable home in Bielitz (present-day Bielsko) in Poland to her miraculous survival and her liberation by American troops—including the man who was to become her husband—in Volary, Czechoslovakia, in 1945, Gerda takes the reader on a terrifying journey. Gerda's serene and idyllic childhood is shattered when Nazis march into Poland on September 3, 1939. Although the Weissmanns were permitted to live for a while in the basement of their home, they were eventually separated and sent to German labor camps. Over the next few years Gerda experienced the slow, inexorable stripping away of ""all but her life."" By the end of the war she had lost her parents, brother, home, possessions, and community; even the dear friends she made in the labor camps, with whom she had shared so many hardships, were dead. Despite her horrifying experiences, Klein conveys great strength of spirit and faith in humanity. In the darkness of the camps, Gerda and her young friends manage to create a community of friendship and love. Although stripped of the essence of life, they were able to survive the barbarity of their captors. Gerda's beautifully written story gives an invaluable message to everyone. It introduces them to last century's terrible history of devastation and prejudice, yet offers them hope that the effects of hatred can be overcome."	261	March 31st 1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/163363.All_But_My_Life

The Sojourn		Rupansh Gupta	4.50	14	10	{5: '9', 4: '4', 3: '0', 2: '1', 1: '0'}	Why are we born? What is the universe? What is time? What is the reason behind everything? How should we live? What is the truth? What matters the most? Did God really intend to keep all this a secret? Or all the truths were always before us and we never came out of ourselves just to look around?These and many more questions have intrigued us all our lives. The education of a child in ancient times had knowledge pertaining to these questions as an integral part. But as we moved towards modern times, we lost many things which matter the most. We have lost the way of our lives with no one to show us the light. All our education and knowledge revolve around making a living. But though it may be potent to tell us how to make a living, it fails to impart us the knowledge of how to live. Moreover, we seldom find any time to read any books concerning matters outside our vocational realm. ‘The Sojourn’ is an attempt to fill the gap. In the most succinct yet captivating way, the book opens doors to many truths. It is a journey of not only our lives but the entire universe. By reading the book and totally immersing in it, the reader will find himself in a new dimension. His way of seeing everything will change. The truth, if manipulated, becomes a lie. The more efforts are made to hide it, the more it loses its identity. Therefore, what was always lying before us will be known to us forever. The truth is simple and elegant. That’s why it is the truth. By knowing its true nature and essence, we will see everything in its true grandeur.On including ‘The Sojourn’ in the curriculums, the students will come to know how to conduct their lives in the most effective way. They will find a guiding light in any situation of their lives. On repeated readings, the book will become a part of their subconscious mind and consequently, their second nature. This will give them a meaning and purpose for their lives. Those who have passed their study phase can read the book and implement the principles in their lives. The book will change their perception and will help them find their purpose. They will find the ways to resolve anything, since they will know the reason and true nature of all the existence. Thus, ‘The Sojourn’ is a book that will transform. When read with an open mind, and several times, new thoughts and truths will emerge each time, to ponder over. No matter whatsoever the situation a person may be in; on reading the book with a quiet mind and reflecting upon it, he will find solutions and ways out. With the limited time in our lives, these thirty five pages of poems will become a facilitator in real sense of the word. Therefore, the book is meant for everyone and will make the foundations of all civilizations very strong.Trailers:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6H2rq...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAZeOe...	152	May 22nd 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18052656-the-sojourn

To some of us, home is everything. Our connection to the past, a place in which to build a future, the only place to run when the world we know falls apart….	For Livie Harrington, Bliss is everything. It’s a house comprised of memories, the last remaining link to her past. In a life shattered by the war between the states, Bliss becomes Livie’s anchor, the driving force behind her desperate scramble to rebuild a lost family fortune. She’s lost her parents, her only love, and her brother is off fighting somewhere north of the Mason-Dixon. She can’t lose Bliss, too… but what’s a girl to do besides the most outlandish, most lucrative endeavor to arise from the Federal blockade?	Everything is going well for Livie when a desperate need to be home invades her busy life. A need she can’t ignore. But waiting for Livie is a houseful of trouble… her dying brother, and the man who risked everything to honor his last wish… the man who broke Livie’s heart long ago, and whom she thought never to see again….A house built to outlast the generations….	After achieving great wealth, Colin Harrington, Livie’s grandson, travels to England to bring a bride back home to Bliss, stately seat of his empire. He meets and marries Lady Jane, whose father is titled but debt-ridden, and before long, Jane is expecting Colin’s heir. Yet, one ill-fated decision tears Jane’s world apart when the luxury liner HMS Titanic on which she and Colin are traveling hits an iceberg in the icy North Atlantic and sinks.	Facing a life without her husband is difficult for Jane, and if not for Bridgett, her lady’s maid, and the kind staff at Bliss, she might have lacked the courage to carry on. A new home, in a strange new land, and the first thing she must do is bury her husband in the family plot. Plagued by nightmares of the sinking ship, her health is in jeopardy, and it is decided that she needs a distraction to help her deal with her grief.	Bliss has everything… a sweeping expanse of lawn that borders the sound, tall trees, and lush bushes… everything but a garden like the one Jane left behind in England. A garden on the scale of the one she is planning will require a gardener, and Jane’s handyman has the perfect candidate… handsome, earthy Brennan Brown.	The Irishman, like Jane, is newly come to America, and somewhat put off to be working for a member of the English aristocracy. Yet, despite coming from very different backgrounds, the two strike up an unlikely friendship that soon lends to the melding of their hearts. Yet, as Jane and Brennan feel the stirrings of a new love, outside forces threaten. The mysterious Mr. Brown, like Jane, has come to the Carolinas looking for a new start... leaving behind a past that comes back to haunt him, threatening not only his relationship with Jane, but his freedom.A place where lives are lived, and new legacies are forged….	It is the tumultuous 1960’s, a time of upheaval and social unrest. Scenes from the Viet Nam War are played out nightly in living rooms across the country, and the great house on the sound has passed into the care of another family.	April has fond memories of summers at Bliss, and after her fairytale wedding disintegrates, it becomes her refuge. The one place where she can attempt to pull the threads of a life unraveling back together. Yet, unbeknownst to April, the stately house has been neglected in recent years. The once sound roof is leaking in a few dozen places, and the wharf is falling apart. Nothing is the same as she remembers—except for Hale, a Viet Nam soldier who is haunted by a dreadful secret, and who is also her brother’s best friend. .. a brother killed in the conflict that is tearing the country apart.	In Hale’s presence, April finds familiarity, and solace. They share a grief for a lost loved one, and from the comfort of his arms, passion blooms. Yet, April’s future is unresolved. A wealthy, arrogant almost-bridegroom wants her back… and the ghosts of Viet Nam are whispering to her new love.The final resting place for a shattered marriage… or a cherished place to rebuild….	Bobby Wayne Forsythe is Nascar’s darling. He’s a superstar of the circuit, and on the verge of becoming a has-been because of a tragic accident. Broken in body, and bruised in spirit, he returns to the place where he can lick his wounds and come to grips with his own dark future… a house he has shared with four now-ex-wives. 	Bobby Wayne has played it fast and loose, enjoying his celebrity status, and women have come and gone with regularity… but there is one woman he couldn’t forget… the one who shows up at his door unexpectedly.	Lauren’s marriage to Bobby Wayne was bittersweet, and coming back to the home they shared is not an easy thing to do… but she desperately needs to put the past behind her, and get on with her life. But when the Country Music star arrives at Bliss, the home she dearly loved, she finds herself confronted—not by a time-honored residence—but a glaring tribute to Bobby Wayne’s career.

There’s a change in Bobby Wayne as well, and though Lauren remains determined to lay their past to rest, she finds it harder to do than she ever imagined.

Secret of Bog Lane		Americo Tulipano	4.63	8	3	{5: '6', 4: '1', 3: '1', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	In a historic American town, on a dead-end road named Bog Lane, a spacious home goes up for sale. Located near Cape Cod Bay, the house comes with six acres of lush woodlands. Its owner, a wealthy geologist, instructs a real-estate agent to sell the place at a substantially reduced price as quickly as possible. The geologist then sets off for Brazil on urgent business. The extraordinary deal lures a hard-working couple and their son to Bog Lane. When they explore the house they find an enormously enlarged basement that contains a vast, tropical garden. This underground jungle is the first in a series of strange turns that increasingly mystify and imperil the home’s new occupants. Thousands of miles away, deep in the Amazon rain forest, an American explorer renews his relationship with an isolated tribe of people known as Inucans. They give him a hero’s welcome, and their veneration only grows when he promises to rid the Inucans of all disease and make them the envy of all nations. But the Inucan chief, and a Bolivian nurse who lives with the tribe, wonder how the visitor intends to achieve these goals. They gradually come to realize that the American is the harbinger of something far less benign than wishful promises.The Secret of Bog Lane unfolds in present-day Brazil and Massachusetts. The people in both locations are in grave danger as they face an evil that is as ancient as the Tower of Babel and as modern as the most advanced scientific technology. 	430				https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13002124-secret-of-bog-lane

Death in the Long Grass: A Big Game Hunter's Adventures in the African Bush		Peter Hathaway Capstick	4.39	1746	105	{5: '972', 4: '557', 3: '163', 2: '35', 1: '19'}	Few men can say they have known Africa as Peter Hathaway Capstick has know it-- leading safaris through lion country; tracking man-eating leopards along tangled jungle paths; running for cover as fear-maddened elephants stampede in all directions. And of the few who have known this dangerous way of life, fewer still can recount their adventures with the flair of this former professional hunter-turned-writer.Based on Capstick's own experiences and the personal accounts of his colleagues, Death in the Long Grass portrays the great killers of the African bush-- not only the lion, leopard, and elephant, but the primitive rhino and the crocodile waiting for its unsuspecting prey, the titanic hippo and the Cape buffalo charging like an express train out of control. Capstick was a born raconteur whose colorful descriptions and eye for exciting, authentic detail bring us face to face with some of the most ferocious killers in the world-- underrated killers like the surprisingly brave and cunning hyena, silent killers such as the lightning-fast black mamba snake, collective killers like the wild dog. Readers can lean back in a chair, sip a tall, iced drink, and revel in the kinds of hunting stories Hemingway and Ruark used to hear in hotel bars from Nairobi to Johannesburg, as veteran hunters would tell of what they heard beyond the campfire and saw through the sights of an express rifle.As thrilling as any novel, as taut and exciting as any adventure story, Death in the Long Grass takes us deep into the heart of darkness to view the Africa that few people have ever seen.	320	January 15th 1978			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/762732.Death_in_the_Long_Grass

Is he a moral visionary or a well-meaning but sometimes misguided moralizer? More important, what might America learn about itself by examining the life and legacy of this enigmatic leader?In Jimmy Carter, American Moralist, the first full-scale biography of Carter since 1980, Kenneth E. Morris shows us that any conclusions about Carter's leadership and its adequacy to his challenges as president cannot ignore the moral quandary that vexed the nation not only under Carter but ever since. Through film and popular music, personality profiles and campaign summaries, poll findings and landmark court decisions, Morris sheds light on the cultural forces that shaped Carter and produced the troubled society that made him president.Carter's story is the moral story of our times, and in asking not whether Carter is ""good"" but whether he has been good for America, we see the promises and pitfalls of our common values."	432	November 1st 1996	['Jimmy Carter']		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2588447-jimmy-carter-american-moralist

The Simplest Book Ever on Life Attitude and Happiness		Martin Gover	4.80	10	3	{5: '8', 4: '2', 3: '0', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	This small book that will offer ideas and concepts that will show you how to make space in the wold for your life. Your dreams and goals.This small book that will demonstrate the steps you take to create adventure, fulfillment, achievement and maybe even miracles in your life.From the Intro:-Attitude is 100% under your control – (yours to choose, use or lose, as they say)Happiness, fulfillment and satisfaction in a life ALWAYS and ONLY come as a consequence of some other activity. That is you don’t just create ‘happy’ or ‘satisfied’ – you have to be doing something with your life that as a byproduct creates these states.Yes - Writing about it is easy; it’s the doing that’s hard.(see Getting Your Mind right)Note 1; success is a personal thing – it’s your success, not what others tell you is successful.Your success is achieving goals, dreams, ideas you believe in, and work forNote 2: to get rich (as with most things) - the book cover of ‘ Think and Grow Rich’ tells you most of what you need to know about getting rich – it’s in the title.The reason that most C students have all the A students working for them is the A students out think everything and the C students don’t know enough to out think themselves.It’s not what you know that creates success, it’s unlearning all the stuff you think you know.People who are; driven, a little crazy, weird and generally anti-social, or considered outside the norm, can create amazing results in their lives because they are focused (fixated)on one desire and are so extreme they don’t know about balance, logic, obvious facts and consequences. They just - DO.This is not about making money, getting rich, owning Lear jets (though none of those are excluded) this is about creating a life that is worth living. This is how to create a life that is full. Adventure? Fulfilled? Exciting? Rewarding? All of that. Absolutely and definitely.And it’s your choice. Yours for the taking.'Any activity where you let go of fears and doubts and inertia, and move toward a goal you desire brings, if not the goal itself (which may or may not be available to you) but brings you a life full of adventure, dedication, excitement and fulfillment – in other words – satisfaction and happiness'	56	November 14th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16155631-the-simplest-book-ever-on-life-attitude-and-happiness

Before the boy can regain his composure and slack back into his familiar world of artifs and hologames, Thomas is torn away from his home and hastily ushered into a secret world of magic. He quickly begins to discover his magic potential and grasp his manifesting abilities, but he lacks perhaps the most important component: control. Yareli Chual, Spirit Summoner and member of The Council of Mages, has been dispatched to recover the boy and bring him to The Council. There he can find the discipline he needs and the answers he seeks, but getting him there alive will be anything but easy. Yareli is not the only one searching for the Scargen boy. Along his journey, Thomas will ride atop a teleport dragon, duel a High Demon of the Depths, run with the Lions of Sirati, outfox a spirit ghost, race a vampire, and quote Shakespeare with a whiskey-swilling werewolf—all the hope of discovering the truth about his father. This quest will be fraught with darkness and malevolence far more unyielding than anything Thomas has come across in his fantasy books. Armed with his newly realized powers and his unlikely companions, Thomas Scargen will have to face this pervasive evil without being entirely consumed by The Shadow of the Gauntlet.

She encountered American society first during the Civil War, a time of great social unrest. Her involvement with the Colored Orphan Asylum put her in the center of the New York City Draft Riots, the largest uprising in the history of the United States.Wilhelmina's story inspired Kelly, who fleshed out the few hard facts she could find with a lovingly researched fictional visit to a long-lost time and place in America's history.""Joanna Kelly...draws special strength from her Quaker faith as well as her insatiable thirst for history in writing her first novel, ""Hooligan's Alley.""

In this haunting 1935 novel, the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of My Ántonia and Death Comes for the Archbishop performs a series of crystalline variations on the themes that preoccupy her greatest fiction: the impermanence of innocence, the opposition between prairie and city, provincial American values and world culture, and the grandeur, elation, and heartache that await a gifted young woman who leaves her small Nebraska town to pursue a life in art.At the age of eighteen, Lucy Gayheart heads for Chicago to study music. She is beautiful and impressionable and ardent, and these qualities attract the attention of Clement Sebastian, an aging but charismatic singer who exercises all the tragic, sinister fascination of a man who has renounced life only to turn back to seize it one last time. Out of their doomed love affair—and Lucy's fatal estrangement from her origins—Willa Cather creates a novel that is as achingly lovely as a Schubert sonata."	208	September 26th 1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/599782.Lucy_Gayheart

His razor sharp sixth sense allows him the freedom to explore the extrasensory messages coming at him like a derailed freight train.And when Benjamin finds a peculiar relic of a key in his grandmother’s garden shed, he could never know his world was about to change forever.There is local legend in the small town of Grandlochcheshire that has been passed down for a 100 years about the mysterious disappearance of the Chickering family, that trails on the coat tails of the equally shocking abduction of the children belonging to the owner of the Skeffington Union Rails. The circumstances that follow this notorious tale enter into the modern world of Benjamin and his two best mates. Annabel and Mathilda, two sisters who have moved to Grandlochcheshire from America, have become more than mere friends to Benjamin, they have all become the three Muskydeers (Mathilda’s mispronounced version of Musketeers, which was a huge laugh and of course it stuck), as they are plunged head first into this curious journey. In the Gilley Forest they discover that the path they have chosen is inundated with many obstacles as well as intrigue. Alliances are made with the Forest clan of Gnomes and with the aid of the Vila sisters, the three friends take on the test that is the Grandfather Tree. They must stay on the pre ordained Path of Prophecy, whose ancestry comes from the home of the oldest living beings on the planet, the Elves of the Darmon. However, this is no easy task for the Muskydeers as they have the foulest of sorcery hunting their every move, the powerful dark beauty, Tar Vigorn…who will stop at nothing to gain entrance into the Great Tree.Through the Door and beneath the enchanted Gilley Forest lies the ever magical land of Coranim...a place of insight, thought and possibilities, with wondrous sites and magic galore. Once in Coranim the children make the acquaintance of the greatest Medicine Elder alive, Esmerelda Fet. A most powerful Light Sorceress with a brazen in your face attitude, and a thick Irish brogue, who guides the trio on their Path of destiny. However, dear reader, a path can change in the blink of an eye.	388	July 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17984619-benjamin-mctish-and-the-door-through-the-grandfather-tree

È un’esplosione liberatrice di vitalità, nel segno del gioco e della trasgressione, per sé e per i suoi lettori. Nasce la leggenda corsara di Sandokan, l’eroe quasi immortale, e dei suoi formidabili tigrotti. Le isole di Mompracem e di Labuan, la giungla nera e il delta acquitrinoso del Gange, l’universo notturno dei sotterranei entrano nell’immaginario collettivo, con le risorse di un linguaggio tecnico di indubbia suggestione e un ritmo narrativo che valorizza i colpi di scena.

Le Tigri di Mompracem, I misteri della jungla nera, I pirati della Malesia, Sandokan alla riscossa, La rivincita di Yanez: sono alcuni dei titoli divenuti ormai a tutti familiari.

The Sun, the Moon, the Stars and Maya: A Collection of Little Sayings about Enormous Things.		Rich Okun	4.75	20	13	{5: '18', 4: '0', 3: '1', 2: '1', 1: '0'}	"The Sun, the Moon, the Stars and Maya is very different kind of book, in a unique format and richly textured with over 90 full color original illustrations and is one of those truly rare books that can be enjoyed equally by a child and a grown-up and most of all both a child and adult together.  ""When I began reading, I was looking for a category to place it in the proper place among all other books that I have read. I soon recognized that Maya moved me beyond content to an experience of thinking and feeling."" - Jacqueline Rhoades, MS ED Review.This book will surprise and delight you and your family and makes the perfect gift.Our lives are bombarded with things that can take us away from the special connections we are capable of. Each of us has the ability to demonstrate love, compassion, gratitude, and generosity. We can choose to live our lives by the Golden Rule. We can make time to appreciate the exquisite construction of our planet and experience the joys of nature. We can look toward the star-spangled heavens, appreciate the velvet silence, and draw peace from spirituality. We have the ability to find beauty in simplicity, and we can marvel at the complexity of what, at first glance, appears deceptively simple. Many of us have just forgotten how. In today's busy, electronics-oriented world, dominated by distractions, special effects, and noisy shoot-'em-ups, simple earth-based spiritual and moral issues have been effectively obscured from view and buried in the smoky haze of the fiery explosion of computer-generated images.In today’s busy, electronics-oriented world, dominated by distractions, special effects, and noisy shoot-’em-ups, simple earth-based spiritual and moral issues have been effectively obscured from view and buried in the smoky haze of the fiery explosion of computer-generated images. The Sun, the Moon, the Stars, and Maya was created to help families discuss important issues with their children. Illustrations of Maya, the Shih Tzu puppy muse, in complementary settings, accompany bits of wisdom relating to spiritual and moral issues. Notable quotations are the inspiration for Maya's simple-language lyrical interpretations meant to evoke awe and wonder in all things and capture the imagination of the child and the child within the parent.

Saving CeeCee Honeycutt
 Beth Hoffman’s bestselling debut, Saving CeeCee Honeycutt, won admirers and acclaim with its heartwarming story and cast of unforgettable characters. Now her unique flair for evocative settings and richly drawn Southern personalities shines in her compelling new novel, Looking for Me. Teddi Overman found her life’s passion for furniture in a broken-down chair left on the side of the road in rural Kentucky. She learns to turn other people’s castoffs into beautifully restored antiques, and eventually finds a way to open her own shop in Charleston. There, Teddi builds a life for herself as unexpected and quirky as the customers who visit her shop.  Though Teddi is surrounded by remarkable friends and finds love in the most surprising way, nothing can alleviate the haunting uncertainty she’s felt in the years since her brother Josh’s mysterious disappearance. When signs emerge that Josh might still be alive, Teddi is drawn home to Kentucky.  It’s a journey that could help her come to terms with her shattered family—and to find herself at last.  But first she must decide what to let go of and what to keep.Looking for Me brilliantly melds together themes of family, hope, loss, and a mature once-in-a-lifetime kind of love. The result is a tremendously moving story that is destined to make bestselling author Beth Hoffman a novelist to whom readers will return again and again as they have with Adriana Trigiani, Fannie Flagg, and Joshilyn Jackson."	354	May 28th 2013		['Red River Gorge, Kentucky', 'Charleston, South Carolina']	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158528-looking-for-me

A Psalm for Cock Robin: A Harp and His (Dead) Mother Mystery		E.E. Doc Murdock	3.50	6	1	{5: '2', 4: '2', 3: '0', 2: '1', 1: '1'}	A Psalm for Cock Robin is the most innovative murder mystery you will ever read. It features a gentle young man named Harp who lives under the Santa Monica pier after he was accidentally released from a mental hospital. When he wakes up one morning to find another homeless man lying dead right next to him, he runs away but soon becomes the main suspect in the murder. Harp must find the killer before the police find him. Sound like a familiar murder mystery plot? Not really. Harp is clearly not much of a detective, but his caustic, sarcastic, Bible-quoting mother is. The only problem is she's dead. But when Harp gets into trouble, she comes into his head to guide him (and harass him) as he searches among a wild assortment of Venice Beach crazies for clues about who the murderer might be. She becomes a sort of second protagonist, always there in Harp's head to keep him on the straight and narrow (often by quoting the grimmest of Grimm's fairy tales, the only thing she let Harp read when he was a child). As weird as this book may sound, it's actually very funny. You'll find yourself laughing out loud, whether you want to or not. It's a classic murder mystery, with a postmodern twist, one you'll never forget.	328	February 27th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17472766-a-psalm-for-cock-robin

Tread of Death: Tragic End to Divine Favor		Dorothy Kardas	5.00	2	1		"Tread of Death: Tragic End to Divine Favor - Dorothy Kardas, Psy.D. Th.D. Without God's Truth, which has supreme and transcendent importance, what is left, are deceptive versions of freedom, relativistic uncertainty, dubiety and skepticism, and hence there is no social conscience and sacred duties; social and political agenda serve selfish, private interests, and the logic of perverted authority, which hold spiritually most devastating, and permanent consequences. Society that accepts as true, false ideas, perversely and ""unlimitedly"" wanting with no regard for the judgment of the Just and Omniscient Judge, regresses rapidly and eventually disintegrates. All societies invariably plunge into an anarchic deviancy becoming rootless, arrogant or cowardly mob of ruinous loggerheads without obeisance to Perennial Truth. For, when the notion of changeless or ultimate Truth, and thus the concomitant existing absolute moral values are denied or repudiated, there is not only an intellectual and spiritual chaos, but modern democracy turns into a totalitarian and arbitrary form of government exercising centralized or absolute control over all aspects of life - evidenced in such abominable symptomatic realities as cruel destruction of preborn life, euthanasia, assisted suicide, In Vitro Fertilization, surrogate ""motherhood,"" contraceptive mentality etc., as well as, the economic reality or the market comes to be a subject of idolatry by being radically and erroneously unconstrained. Acts of will and choices are authentically free only when they are not conformable and servile to vice, errors and imperfections. The one who willfully refuses to follow divine and therefore unerring and limitlessly beneficial orders is in essence practicing disloyalty and disobedience to oneself, and by habituating in sin destroys charity, which inevitably results in a gradual destruction of spiritual life - death of the soul."	232	April 26th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17892676-tread-of-death

A mask of invincibility is rising between a boy and the girl who loves him. Hypnotizing and intense, penetratingly gray as dead starless skies, Cardew's brutally beautiful eyes block his soul behind themselves like lurid mystifying mirrors that can flawlessly reflect others' feelings without showing any of his own... Assuming he ever had such. Nobody knows what hides behind his mask of a hero - least of all his lovely Freya, who lets her obsessions disguised as intuition lead her into his mesmerising labyrinth of insanity and love. When a million masks become the actor's face and they all explode in a single moment, what happens to his uncompromising pride? Best enemies can make the best of friends - but the worst of lovers. Unusual, tempting, and sinisterly beautiful, NIGHTMARISH SACRIFICE is written in a luxurious, excessive Gothic style, imaginatively elaborating on the invisible in its restlessly unpredictable story. At eleven o'clock in the graveyard, you can meet the truth in faces you haven't expected. But some truths are better off dead. And buried.	504	August 19th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18388163-nightmarish-sacrifice
Les caprices d'Anaïs		Bernard Coat L.	5.00	7	0	{5: '7', 4: '0', 3: '0', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	Après être resté en apnée pendant mon adolescence, dans les Univers d’Edgar Alan Poe ou de Stephen King et, bien plus tard, dans les textes de Thomas Harris, j’ai découvert un beau jour la littérature noire de Maurice G.Dantec. J’ai pensé à cet instant-là, que plus rien n’y aucun autre auteur ne pourrait me procurer un tel vertige de lecture. Et puis, il y a les auteurs comme Bernard Coat que l’on rencontre un jour, que l’on découvre, que l’on lit.La plume de Bernard Coat est de celles qui me parlent, que je ressens, que j’affectionne car elles impriment en moi, au fil de leurs lectures, des images, des travellings, des plans-séquences. Cela, peut-être, est-il dû au fait que l’auteur soit avant tout un scénariste de talent, avec pour références de nombreuses collaborations pour de prestigieuses institutions, le cinéma ou bien encore des émissions de variétés télévisées. Son écriture reste aérienne, transparente, parfois très sombre. On retrouve aussi dans les dialogues de ses récits de vraies perles métaphoriques, on y sent aussi bien la patte d’Audiard que celle de Balzac.La narration de Bernard Coat est atypique, parfois hypnotique. Tantôt simple, tantôt utile, parfois « rentre-dedans ». La richesse du vocabulaire de Bernard Coat vaut son pesant d’or et donne ses lettres de noblesse à son roman intitulé « Du sang sur les docks » ; un illustre roman noir, social, intriguant. Cet ouvrage semble être un étrange hybride cinémato-littéraire, issu de l’accouplement de « Fight club » de David Fincher, et de « Usual suspect » de Bryan Singer.La faune éditoriale à encore beaucoup de chemin à parcourir, beaucoup de chasseurs de têtes à recruter. Existe-t-il encore beaucoup d’individus tels que Bernard Coat ? Y-a-t-il encore beaucoup d’auteurs de cette trempe, noyés dans la masse, laissés dans l’ombre, des auteurs qui possèdent de vraies pépites dans leurs tiroirs, de vrais langages et de vraies dentelles littéraires dans leurs crânes ? La réponse est oui, et Bernard COAT en est la parfaite émergence. Il représente, à mon sens, un vrai talent ; la prouesse d’une plume excellente comme il me plaît d’en lire, d’en découvrir et d’en parler. Vous découvrirez au fil de ce roman comment, de manière surprenante, le style narratif de l’auteur vous emmaillotera comme l’arachnide le fait avec ses proies. Vous découvrirez pourquoi au terme de cet ouvrage, vous relirez un jour, peut-être demain ou la semaine suivante, « du » Bernard Coat.Cet ouvrage, passé entre mes mains avant même son édition, m’a fait prendre conscience que le talent ne se cache pas forcément dans les supermarchés, sur des rayons près des paquets de lessives ou des flacons d’eau de toilettes (Dixit l’auteur tel un message subliminal). Non, le talent ne se trouve pas forcément sous les feux de la rampe, à la radio ou sur un plateau télé. A la lecture du Roman noir d’Anaïs, j’ai plongé dans la grâce, la subtilité. La beauté et la justesse de ces phrases-là m’ont parfois bouleversé. J’ai eu l’occasion de passer par différentes phases émotionnelles, par différents paliers sur l’échelle des sensations.« Les caprices d'Anaïs » est une ode à l’humanité. Des personnages bouleversants, charismatiques même, vont et viennent dans une atmosphère assez lourde, presque irréelle et pourtant, si proche de notre réalité. Les tourments de l’homme, ses extravagances, ses viles facettes et sa miséricorde, la vie, la mort, sont dépeints ici dans le raffinement et la virtuosité d’un lyrisme éloquent.Un pur moment de bonheur, une valse littéraire…  Fabio M.Mitchelli		February 14th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17665115-les-caprices-d-ana-s

The Tricking of Freya		Christina Sunley	3.93	886	204	{5: '244', 4: '405', 3: '177', 2: '49', 1: '11'}	"
A young woman obsessed with uncovering a family secret is drawn into the strange and magical history, language and landscape of Iceland.
 Freya Morris grows up in a typical American suburb – but every summer, she enters another realm entirely when she visits her relatives in Gimli, a tiny village in Canada settled by Icelandic immigrants. Here she falls under the spell of her troubled but charming aunt Birdie, who thrills her with stories of exotic Norse goddesses, moody Viking bards, and the life of her late grandfather, the most famous poet of ""New Iceland."" But when Birdie tricks Freya into a terrifying scandal, Freya turns her back on everything Icelandic and anything that reminds her of the past. She is living an anonymous, bleak existence in Manhattan when she finally returns to Gimli for the first time in two decades – and stumbles upon a long concealed family secret. As Freya becomes increasingly obsessed with unraveling her family’s tangled story, she finds herself delving into the very memories she has worked so hard to forget. When the clues dry up in Gimli, Freya journeys to Iceland itself. On this rugged island of vast lava fields and immense glaciers, Freya’s quest comes to its unsettling conclusion. A beautifully-written debut novel that deftly weaves together Iceland’s distinctive history, ancient mythology, reverence for language, and passion for genealogy, The Tricking of Freya is a powerful exploration of kinship, loss and redemption."	344	March 3rd 2009		['Iceland']	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4366431-the-tricking-of-freya

He leaned from the saddle and dropped one end of each of the two upper bars to the ground, stepped his horse over the remaining bar and, stooping again, replaced the others. Then he rode slowly along a dirt road that showed little signs of travel.As he rode he seemed but an animated part of the surrounding landscape, so perfectly did he harmonize from the crown of his Stetson to the light shod hoofs of his pony.Everything that he wore seemed a part of him, as he seemed a part of his horse. His well worn chaps, his cartridge belt and holster, his shirt and bandana, like the leather of his horse trappings, were toned and mellowed by age and usage; yet they carried the same suggestion of strength and freshness and efficiency as did his bronzed face and his clear, gray eyes.	320	April 1st 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1041302.Deputy_Sheriff_of_Comanche_County

Stranded on an uncharted rocky island, his body broken by the crash, John Robert is adopted into a tribe of Eskimos.

Deep Winter		Samuel W. Gailey	3.34	492	111	{5: '81', 4: '152', 3: '146', 2: '78', 1: '35'}	For fans of Alice Sebold and Scott Smith, a dark, gripping debut novel of literary suspense about a devastating murder in an isolated town that appears to be the work of a man with the mind of a child—but could the truth be hidden in the swirling snow?In the small town of Wyalusing in eastern Pennsylvania, a woman is found brutally murdered one winter night. Next to the body is Danny Bedford, a misunderstood man who suffered a tragic brain injury that left him with limited mental capabilities. Despite his simple life, his intimidating size has caused his neighbors to ostracize him in fear. So when the local bully-turned-deputy discovers Danny with the body it’s obvious that Danny’s physical strength has finally turned deadly. But in the long, freezing night that follows, the murder is only the first in a series of crimes that viciously upset the town order—an unstoppable chain of violence that appears to make Danny’s guilt increasingly undeniable. With the threat of an approaching blizzard, the local sheriff and a state trooper work through the pre-dawn hours to establish some semblance of peace. As they investigate one incident after another, they discover an intricate web of lies that reveals that not everything in Wyalusing is quite what it seems. With echoes of Scott Smith’s A Simple Plan and Tana French’s In the Woods, Deep Winter is a richly atmospheric and ingeniously plotted novel that is surprising to the final page. It’s impossible to escape this bone-chilling story of deception where the truth is uncertain and something sinister is lurking just below the surface…	304	February 20th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18079758-deep-winter

Tagebücher 1982-2001		Fritz J. Raddatz	4.16	38	7	{5: '15', 4: '18', 3: '2', 2: '2', 1: '1'}	Ein Buch wie dieses hat es noch nicht gegeben. Von Augstein bis Marion Dönhoff, von Grass bis Enzensberger, von Hochhuth bis Kempowski zeigt es die deutschen Intellektuellen, ja überhaupt die ganze bundesrepublikanische Gesellschaft, wie sie so hellsichtig nie beschrieben worden ist: wahrgenommen mit dem Sensorium eines Hochempfindsamen, subjektiv und zutreffend, anteilnehmend, scharfzüngig. Das Buch, das von der Kritik immer erhofft, von den Schriftstellern aber nie geschrieben worden ist – der große Gesellschaftsroman der Bundesrepublik, das balzacsche Porträt unserer Zeit –, hier ist es.Und vermutlich war niemand so geeignet, es zu schreiben, wie Fritz J. Raddatz. In Deutschland ist er der widersprüchlichste Intellektuelle seiner Generation: anziehend durch seinen Witz, distanzierend durch seinen Eigensinn, geistreich, gebildet, streitbar und umstritten – und immer, bei aller Geselligkeit, von einer Empfindung der Unzugehörigkeit bestimmt. Schon in den sechziger Jahren hat Erich Kuby über ihn gesagt, daß für so jemanden in Deutschland eigentlich kein Platz sei.Kubys Urteil bestätigt sich im Lebensgefühl des Tagebuchschreibers. Raddatz zeigt sich hier unmaskiert, als hochmütiger Melancholiker und treuer Freund, als Hypochonder, Misanthrop, Zweifler. Das ist die Entstehensbedingung dieser Aufzeichnungen, die von Raddatz’ letzten Jah­ren als Feuilletonchef der ZEIT bis zum Be­ginn des neuen Jahrhunderts reichen und im Fall der Mauer, in der deutschen Wiederverei­nigung ihren kontroversenreichen Mittelpunkt haben.	944	2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9302673-tageb-cher-1982-2001

But only in death could I confirm this ... So begins the haunting and captivating tale, set in 1935 China, of the ghost of a young woman named Leiyin, who watches her own funeral from above and wonders why she is being denied entry to the afterlife. Beside her are three souls—stern and scholarly yang; impulsive, romantic yin; and wise, shining hun—who will guide her toward understanding. She must, they tell her, make amends.As Leiyin delves back in time with the three souls to review her life, she sees the spoiled and privileged teenager she once was, a girl who is concerned with her own desires while China is fractured by civil war and social upheaval. At a party, she meets Hanchin, a captivating left-wing poet and translator, and instantly falls in love with him.When Leiyin defies her father to pursue Hanchin, she learns the harsh truth—that she is powerless over her fate. Her punishment for disobedience leads to exile, an unwanted marriage, a pregnancy, and, ultimately, her death. And when she discovers what she must do to be released from limbo into the afterlife, Leiyin realizes that the time for making amends is shorter than she thought.Suffused with history and literature, Three Souls is an epic tale of revenge and betrayal, forbidden love, and the price we are willing to pay for freedom.	439	August 20th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18169712-three-souls

The History of the Ancient World: From the Earliest Accounts to the Fall of Rome	The History of the World #1	Susan Wise Bauer	4.09	4031	402	{5: '1511', 4: '1636', 3: '683', 2: '150', 1: '51'}	This is the first volume in a bold new series that tells the stories of all peoples, connecting historical events from Europe to the Middle East to the far coast of China, while still giving weight to the characteristics of each country. Susan Wise Bauer provides both sweeping scope and vivid attention to the individual lives that give flesh to abstract assertions about human history. Dozens of maps provide a clear geography of great events, while timelines give the reader an ongoing sense of the passage of years and cultural interconnection. This narrative history employs the methods of “history from beneath”—literature, epic traditions, private letters and accounts—to connect kings and leaders with the lives of those they ruled. The result is an engrossing tapestry of human behavior from which we may draw conclusions about the direction of world events and the causes behind them.	896	March 17th 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/225947.The_History_of_the_Ancient_World

As she struggles to break free of the grim life into which she was born, she continues to suffer the daily assaults from her mother and the dispiriting weakness of her dejected father. When Chloe unexpectedly finds herself drawn into a new, warm life abundant in love and romance with a kindhearted man named Alex, the escape at last gives her a happiness that she's never been allowed to feel. However, when hidden truths reveal a life that she cannot remember, Chloe finds herself lost between what is real and what isn't.

As pages working on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, they hoped to rub elbows with famous and powerful people, and be a part of a world other teenagers back home could only dream about. For a while, they wouldn’t be disappointed. Yet, a hidden world also awaited them that their young minds could not have envisioned – a vicious world of lawlessness and corruption they never expected to find on the Hill. Before any of them realized it, they would find themselves swallowed up in a universe from which they would be lucky to escape with their lives.	364	September 30th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18659364-the-buddy-system

Matrix Analysis	Graduate Texts in Mathematics #169	Rajendra Bhatia	3.85	13	1	{5: '3', 4: '5', 3: '5', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	A good part of matrix theory is functional analytic in spirit. This statement can be turned around. There are many problems in operator theory, where most of the complexities and subtleties are present in the finite-dimensional case. My purpose in writing this book is to present a systematic treatment of methods that are useful in the study of such problems. This book is intended for use as a text for upper division and gradu- ate courses. Courses based on parts of the material have been given by me at the Indian Statistical Institute and at the University of Toronto (in collaboration with Chandler Davis). The book should also be useful as a reference for research workers in linear algebra, operator theory, mathe- matical physics and numerical analysis. A possible subtitle of this book could be Matrix Inequalities. A reader who works through the book should expect to become proficient in the art of deriving such inequalities. Other authors have compared this art to that of cutting diamonds. One first has to acquire hard tools and then learn how to use them delicately. The reader is expected to be very thoroughly familiar with basic lin- ear algebra.

Death of the Mad Hatter		Sarah J. Pepper	4.02	340	154	{5: '141', 4: '115', 3: '48', 2: '21', 1: '15'}	Never in my wildest dreams did I consider the possibility that I could fall for the boy with the girl's name. Why couldn't Ryley have bacne, chronic case of nose bleeds, genetic baldness, or uncontrollable gingivitis? Oh no, he had to be perfect in every way. And, that body... Nuff said. It was all I could do to convince my knees not to weaken at the sight of him. Forming coherent words when he spoke my name was dang near impossible. Perhaps if his frontal lobe was a teensy weensy smaller, I might have been able to convince myself that he wasn't so intellectually stimulating. But, he was stimulating,in more ways than one; there was no denying that; no matter how badly I tried to hate him, I couldn't. That made what I was about to do so delightfully horrible that even the wicked Queen of Hearts would be impressed--Alice Mae.	333	November 29th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18395230-death-of-the-mad-hatter

Ruling a vast country with the iron grip of religion and the steel persuasion of swords they are of unquestionable power. But within the borders of the Cruciform Realm a group of freedom fighters form under the long absent and near mythical Soulborn; Kaszak, meanwhile outside the borders of the Realm other, more sinister, foes begin to wake. The Renders, long crippled from their defeat at the hands of the Angels, stir once again in the frozen north, undying and able to steal the life from their foes their patience is matched only by their ruthlessness. Creatures of fire and creatures of shadow, the long warring Drakes and Vash’near now turn their eyes from one another and towards the Realm of the Angels. In his distant fortress the Necromaster defiles the mass graves of the war fought almost a thousand years ago and restores the fallen warriors to fight again in his quest for vengeance. Most dangerous of all though is the human who has stumbled on the lost knowledge. For half his life Marneth has manipulated countries and wars in a ceaseless effort to free humanity, and destroy the Elder Races in the process. Conflicting loyalties and ideals clash as nations and races fight for what they believe to be right; and there is no greater motivation to cruelty than benevolence.	331	July 11th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18813386-the-dancing-soul-of-fire
This Changes Everything	The Spanners #1	Sally Ember	3.75	118	24	{5: '61', 4: '19', 3: '7', 2: '9', 1: '22'}	"Are YOU ready for the changes? The five alien delegates from the Many Worlds Collective (MWC) come in hologram form to the selected liaison for Earth, Clara Branon, Ph.D., 58, for the first time on December 21, 2012, after several millennia of mostly secret visits and contact with Earthers. Members of the MWC InterGalactic Council decide that a liaison, dubbed the Chief Communicator (CC) must be contacted and that this contact must be made public in order to avert multiple types of disasters on Earth. As a “Spanner,” Clara is one of millions of “Baby Boomers” who survive across two centuries and bridge the divide (hence, “Spanners”) between nonpublic and public contact with the MWC and many other major changes that occur during these decades. Because most Earthers are not prepared to accept this type of reporting or storytelling as nonfiction, this first and some other volumes of the series are of the realistic fiction/science fiction/fantasy/ romance genres. Many of the characters, events and locations are actual; some are not, or haven’t happened (yet) at the time of first publication. In ""This Changes Everything"" are: a love story, spanning about 40 years; dialogue and scenes of the relationships among the CC and her mother and siblings; communications between the CC and her adult son; dialogue between the CC and some friends; info about the selection and identity of the chosen media contact for the CC, with excerpts from her journal; news stories about the CC and the MWC events from Earth media as well as MWC media; background about the CC and the reasons for her being selected; excepts from minutes of meetings of the InterGalactic Council of the MWC; and much more. After the MWC educational resources and information become widely available, in 2013, all time is now known to be simultaneous. Writing from any point in time and timeline means that the love story and other aspects are depicted in multiple versions. Will Clara and her love, Epifanio Dang, be together? Which Re-set of the Transition After Public Contact prevails?Tone is humorous/serious; mode is utopian. Narrative and themes include history, poetry, literature, music/lyrics, science and technological advances, psi phenomena/ paranormal skills, law and government, Buddhism and other religions, meditation, social-emotional intelligence, multiverse/multiple timelines, time and space travel, interspecies communication, and social/futuristic depictions of the Earth, post-MWC public contact. ""This Changes Everything"" is the first of ""The Spanners Series,"" which chronicles the public contact between the CC and the MWC and the impact of these contacts on Earthers and the MWC over the almost 30 years that Clara is the CC. Chapters are written from several perspectives. Some Volumes in series are purported to be nonfiction or have nonfiction sections, as this one is.Sci-Fi/Romance/Speculative Fiction, Adult/ New Adult/YA genre novels are in the 10-volume series. Volume II, ""This Changes My Family and My Life Forever,"" releases in Spring, 2014. Appendix A has annotated descriptions for all 10 volumes; App. B &amp; C are Glossaries. App D. lists the actual individuals referred to in the Volumes, annotated.

Quantum Demonology		Sheila Eggenberger	4.50	12	2	{5: '8', 4: '3', 3: '0', 2: '1', 1: '0'}	"""If Faust were a 21st century metal-minded former punk with too much libido and a major attitude problem, this would be her story.""KIRKUS REVIEWIn Eggenberger’s debut novel, an aging heavy-metal music fan and aspiring writer sells her soul to the devil and finds there’s a lot more to life than good and evil.The novel’s unnamed, Scandinavian narrator has long enjoyed the freedom of being an unattached, self-described “nympho slut” and “metalhead.” However, she struggles to find time to write between shifts at her day job, and as she approaches her 47th birthday, she begins to worry that her writing career may never take off the way she’d planned and that her steady stream of young one-night stands may soon dry up. One day, as she steals a few hours to write in a Copenhagen coffee shop, a dead ringer for her favorite metal musician approaches her. She recognizes him, not as the rock icon he resembles, but as the devil himself. He offers her the promise of the writing career—and love life—she’s always dreamed of in exchange for her soul, but she’s reluctant. The devil is not accustomed to hearing “no,” and so he instead persuades her to help him destroy his wife, the biblical Lilith, before she destroys the world. As the tough-as-nails narrator’s sultry romance with the devil begins and her writing career skyrockets toward celebrity status, she finds that the real world is a lot more nuanced than the one purported by so-called moralists. The novel has distinct, well-developed feminist undertones and proves to be about much more than a powerful woman destroying another powerful woman. Fans of the long-esteemed feminist heroine Lilith may be disappointed to see her as the villain here, but she proves to be an antagonist of Maleficent-esque proportions, and readers may be torn between fearing and loving her character. Feminist readers may also be pleased to see that the tomboy narrator ultimately finds camaraderie with a well-researched group of legendary women, including the Norse goddess, Freya, and her handmaiden Fulla.An engaging, modern-day Faust for brainy rockers.Pub Date:Dec. 17th, 2013ISBN:978-0991105908Page count:610ppPublisher:Nigel's FlightProgram:Kirkus IndieReview Posted Online:Feb. 12th, 2014"	610	December 17th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19045334-quantum-demonology

It's a world in which she can escape some of her more painful childhood realities, like those games her father likes to make her play, where he's the boss and she the naughty secretary. And her mother so fiercely favors her younger brother, the cherubic Willy, that Thelma finds herself perpetually in emotional exile. No wonder Thelma asks practically every adult she meets to adopt her. Along Thelma's bumpy way from a rural English village to Canada to a law degree at Oxford, she meets many potential parents and even makes some friends, but it is with the companions of her fertile imagination—with the scaredy-baby Janawee, moody and timid Ginniger, and big, strong, stoic Heroin—that Thelma finds comfort. With them, too, she loses an already tenuous connection to reality, though ultimately Thelma's spirit and humor prove to be as indomitable as her wit. ""Moving and comic at once....

Unlike most of his competitors, Geiger rarely sheds blood, but he does use a variety of techniques—some physical, many psychological—to push his subjects to a point where pain takes a backseat to fear. Because only then will they finally stop lying.One of Geiger's rules is that he never works with children. So when his partner, former journalist Harry Boddicker, unwittingly brings in a client who demands that Geiger interrogate a twelve-year-old boy, Geiger responds instinctively. He rescues the boy from his captor, removes him to the safety of his New York City loft, and promises to protect him from further harm. But if Geiger and Harry cannot quickly discover why the client is so desperate to learn the boy's secret, they themselves will become the victims of an utterly ruthless adversary.Mesmerizing and heart-in-your-throat compelling, The Inquisitor is a completely unique thriller that introduces both an unforgettable protagonist and a major new talent in Mark Allen Smith."	336	April 10th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12160887-the-inquisitor

The Titans told it true, for we were bred and domesticated, not to have any Natural means of Defense, but our Mind, again why. To Covet first the Apple and then thy Brothers’,for then and only then, did They know, we were ready to be set loose upon the World? Darwin traced it true, water the Origin of our Species.

Institute breeding programs, do we not school Beasts. To do what we cannot or do not wish to do. Could we, not be set upon the same tasks? Do all the old stories tell the same tale? What a story that would be? Would it tell of our Origins and our rise? Would it tell us why, the same Motifs, Echo down the Halls of Time.Would we even now in this day and age accept the Lessons that they teach, Parables, Metaphors? What is the underlining message, what vein runs true? The tale I am about to unfold, may be true. I will let you, judge for yourself. How much Whim, how much Fancy. It begins with the dark and loneliness of Space, so like the depths of our great Oceans. An irony that I hope is not lost on you. Depths we have barely scratched, why I ask is it so.

We all know, man was Created, but for What, A reflection of Who. Shall I tell you, will these words ever be seen by another? Will they be considered the drug induced ravings of madness?

Star of action blockbuster Alpha Papa; a man with a fascinating past and an amazing future.Gregarious and popular, yet Alan’s never happier than when relaxing in his own five-bedroom, south-built house with three acres of land and access to a private stream. But who is this mysterious enigma?Alan Gordon Partridge is the best – and best-loved – radio presenter in the region. Born into a changing world of rationing, Teddy Boys, apes in space and the launch of ITV, Alan’s broadcasting career began as chief DJ of Radio Smile at St. Luke’s Hospital in Norwich. After replacing Peter Flint as the presenter of Scout About, he entered the top 8 of BBC sports presenters.But Alan’s big break came with his primetime BBC chat show Knowing Me, Knowing You. Sadly, the show battled against poor scheduling, having been put up against News at Ten, then in its heyday. Due to declining ratings, a single catastrophic hitch (the killing of a guest on air) and the dumbing down of network TV, Alan’s show was cancelled. Not to be dissuaded, he embraced this opportunity to wind up his production company, leave London and fulfil a lifelong ambition to return to his roots in local radio.Now single, Alan is an intensely private man but he opens up, for the second time, in this candid, entertaining, often deeply emotional – and of course compelling – memoir, written entirely in his own words. (Alan quickly dispelled the idea of using a ghost writer. With a grade B English Language O-Level, he knew he was up to the task.)He speaks touchingly about his tragic Toblerone addiction, and the painful moment when unsold copies of his first autobiography, Bouncing Back, were pulped like ‘word porridge’. He reveals all about his relationship with his ex-Ukrainian girlfriend, Sonja, with whom he had sex at least twice a day, and the truth about the thick people who make key decisions at the BBC.A literary tour de force, I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan charts the incredible journey of one of our greatest broadcasters.	320	September 29th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12363948-i-partridge

As the hapless Thelonious keeps ending up in the wrong place at the wrong time, he attracts the attention of Detective Chief Inspector Horatio Sidebottom of Norfolk Constabulary CID, who’s determined to tie Thelonious to the crimes. Add in a pair of hoods from London’s East End, celebrity TV chef Paolo Louis Black, and plenty of oddball local characters and it all adds up to a madcap journey through England’s most quirky county, where everything is normal for Norfolk!From bestselling author Mitzi Szereto, co-authored with her celebrity sidekick bear Teddy Tedaloo.“For anyone who’s ever wondered what Paddington at Large would have been like if it had been written by Raymond Chandler—and who hasn’t?—Mitzi Szereto has the answer. Like Philip Marlowe, Szereto’s Thelonious T. Bear is a modern knight errant who plays it cool even as the light of suspicion shines on him. And like Paddington, he’s short of stature and long on charm. If you like your sleuths tough, cynical and cute as a button, Normal for Norfolk is the book for you.” —Steve Hockensmith, author of Holmes on the Range and Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the Dreadfuls“Normal for Norfolk has it all: magic, gritty realism, humor, cultural commentary, intelligence, charm, and suspense. The hero of this novel, Thelonious T. Bear, finds himself at the heart of a mystery. He’s a photojournalist like no other, a pub-loving, anthropomorphized bear who wears cologne and a deerstalker hat.

The ability to see the potential for a strong picture and then organize the graphic elements into an effective, compelling composition has always been one of the key skills in making photographs.Digital photography has brought a new, exciting aspect to design - first because the instant feedback from a digital camera allows immediate appraisal and improvement; and second because image-editing tools make it possible to alter and enhance the design after the shutter has been pressed. This has had a profound effect on the way digital photographers take pictures.Now published in sixteen languages, The Photographer's Eye continues to speak to photographers everywhere. Reaching 100,000 copies in print in the US alone, and 300,000+ worldwide, it shows how anyone can develop the ability to see and shoot great digital photographs. The book explores all the traditional approaches to composition and design, but crucially, it also addresses the new digital technique of shooting in the knowledge that a picture will later be edited, manipulated, or montaged to result in a final image that may be very different from the one seen in the viewfinder.	192	May 23rd 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/513523.The_Photographer_s_Eye

The Scorpion's Tale		['Gregory Denaro', 'Wayne Block']	3.92	49	5	{5: '18', 4: '16', 3: '9', 2: '5', 1: '1'}	Bred to kill, he is the perfect weapon. Omniscient, and never seen; a soulless assassin until a fatal mistake. Now he is hunted by a father for killing his wife and children. A continent away, another family slaughtered. A beautiful daughter teams with a Mafia enforcer on her own quest to find him. A story of revenge and redemption; the tale of the Scorpion.Thanks to the killer’s handiwork, Tony’s partners were also dead in Manhattan. The killer needed to finish his business in Westhampton tonight, so he could make his flight to Italy before any of the bodies were discovered. From his neck down he dressed like a surgeon with cotton coverings over his clothes and shoes that were specially made to fit although they were two sizes too large. He also wore latex gloves and a ski-mask to ensure that his entire body was protected against leaving even a cell of his DNA behind. Looking into the eyes of his victims in their final moment of life did not faze him. In fact, it gave him pleasure. The sound of Tony’s head smashing into the door disturbed him only because the success or failure of an assignment might hinge upon an unknown factor – variables that were his job to minimize. He never left anything to chance, carefully tending to the crime scene, making sure there was no evidence to assist law enforcement. Satisfied all was in order, he silently exited the master bedroom, gun in hand. Amanda tried the light switch in the kitchen, but it didn’t work. She opened the refrigerator door, found a pitcher of water, and poured a tall glass for her and Catarina to share. She replaced the pitcher, closed the refrigerator, took a step into the hallway and immediately noticed a large shadow of a person, obviously much taller than Tony. She shrieked in surprise and dropped the glass, which shattered. The killer reacted without conscious thought. He instinctively raised his gun and fired. Amanda made a loud moaning sound as she crumpled to the floor. Suddenly there was another scream behind him. He turned and aimed at the sound, not realizing that his gun was pointed at a forty-five degree angle toward the floor. He fired again and there was silence. It took only a split second for him to realize that the voice had screamed “Mommy.” Bred to kill, he is the perfect weapon. A soulless assassin until a fatal mistake. Now he is hunted by a father for killing his wife and children. A continent away, another family slaughtered. A beautiful daughter teams with a Mafia enforcer on her own quest to find him.

Beneath the Bamboo: A Vietnam War Story		Stan Taylor	4.22	230	14	{5: '115', 4: '68', 3: '35', 2: '6', 1: '6'}	Excerpt: “I watched two point men take a 50-caliber machine gun bullet to the head, and watched the third being grabbed and taken behind enemy lines. Two of the enemy soldiers, which we often referred to as gooks, quickly came after me. As I quickly mowed them down with my automatic rifle, I crawled backwards away from the enemy gunfire, using my helmet to push sand in front of me as I went, which made it possible to look behind me. But as I looked back, I realized that my safety net was no longer safe. I saw my entire company falling like dominoes. Medics were running left and right, risking their lives to help others with bravery that even the most amazing soldier couldn’t hope to match. Some of the events I witnessed during that moment were beyond comprehension. I watched a young, courageous black medic take an 81-millimeter round to his head, and his whole body instantly turned to smoke. Young nineteen and twenty year old kids were crying like children, but fighting like someone had raped their sisters. So many things were going through my head at that moment, and in one single heartbeat I was overwhelmed with a flashback of my entire life. This is my story, from point A to B, of my life and times in the midst of hell on Earth.”	180	December 17th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17159189-beneath-the-bamboo

The Monkey's Voyage: How Improbable Journeys Shaped the History of Life		Alan de Queiroz	3.70	283	54	{5: '60', 4: '118', 3: '75', 2: '21', 1: '9'}	Throughout the world, closely related species are found on landmasses separated by wide stretches of ocean. What explains these far-flung distributions? Why are species found where they are across the Earth? Since the discovery of plate tectonics, scientists have long conjectured that plants and animals were scattered over the globe by riding pieces of ancient supercontinents as they broke up. In the past decade, however, that theory has foundered, as the genomic revolution has made reams of new genetic data available. And the data has revealed an extraordinary, stranger-than-fiction story that has sparked a scientific revolution. In The Monkey's Voyage, biologist Alan de Queiroz introduces a radical new theory of how species as diverse as monkeys, baobab trees, and burrowing lizards made incredible long-distance ocean crossings: pregnant animals and wind-blown plants rode rafts and icebergs and even stowed away on the legs of sea-going birds to create the map of life we see today. In other words, these organisms were not merely victims of continental fate; they were masters of their geographic destiny. And as de Queiroz shows, the effects of oceanic dispersal have been crucial in generating the diversity of life on Earth, from monkeys and guinea pigs in South America to beech trees and kiwi birds in New Zealand. By toppling the idea that the slow process of continental drift drove odd distributions of organisms, this new theory highlights the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the history of life. In the tradition of John McPhee’s Basin and Range, The Monkey's Voyage is a beautifully told narrative of a profound investigation into the importance of contingency in history and the nature of scientific discovery.	368	January 7th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14894653-the-monkey-s-voyage

Gaza Writes Back (#1)		Refaat Alareer	4.23	182	20	{5: '95', 4: '54', 3: '20', 2: '6', 1: '7'}	"""Gaza Writes Back: Short Stories from Young Writers in Gaza, Palestine"", edited by Refaat Alareer is a compelling collection of short stories from fifteen young writers in Gaza, members of a generation that has suffered immensely under Israel’s siege and blockade. Their experiences, especially during and following Israel’s 2008-2009 offensive known as “Operation Cast Lead”, have fundamentally impacted their lives and their writing. Indeed, many of these writers saw the war as a catalyst for their writing, as they sought an outlet and a voice in its aftermath. They view the book as a means of preserving Palestinian memories and presenting their own narratives to the world without filters. Their words take us into the homes and hearts of moms, dads, students, children, and elders striving to live lives of dignity, compassion, and meaning in one of the world’s most embattled communities. (Some of the stories also take us with courage and empathy into the imagined world of Israelis living just on the other side of the great barriers Israel has built in and around Gaza and the West Bank to wall the Palestinians in.) These stories are acts of resistance and defiance, proclaiming the endurance of Palestinians and the continuing resilience and creativity of their culture in the face of ongoing obstacles and attempts to silence them.  Whether tackling the tragedy that surrounds missile strikes and home raids, or the everyday indignities encountered by Palestinian refugees, Gaza Writes Back brings to life the real issues that the people of Gaza face. One prominent theme in many of the stories is the value placed on the wisdom of parents and grandparents. A sense of longing pervades the book, as the characters in the stories reveal desires ranging from the mundane to the complex—including, in several of the stories, a strong yearning to return to the characters’ long-cherished family homes and properties after many decades in exile from them. Social differences within Gaza are also sensitively explored. A few stories are especially difficult—but critical—to digest , for the vividness with which they depict the experiences of victims of Israeli military strikes and confront the legacy of violence and occupation, particularly on young people.Readers will be moved by the struggles big and small that emerge from the well-crafted writing by these young people, and by the hope and courage that radiates from the authors’ biographies. The contributors are university students and recent graduates, Palestinians who have chosen to speak out in their second language, which is an “expressive way to be more creative in a world where words are significantly mighty,” according to Tasnim Hamouda. Another contributor, Nour El Borno, believes “that if a person can write effectively, it is his or her duty to get up, write, and help change this world to something better.” Five years after Operation Cast Lead, these stories remind us that the pain lingers on and the people of Gaza will be forever scarred by the attack. Yet, the call for justice remains forceful and persistent, and these young Gazan writers refuse to let the world forget about them—their land, their people, and their story."	208	January 15th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18754110-gaza-writes-back

Acrescentou-se «A Caleche» (1836), pequeno conto que alguns autores integram neste ciclo. Trata-se do chamado «segundo período» da obra do autor, que se seguiu ao período das histórias ucranianas - «Noites na Granja ao pé de Dikanka» e «Mírgorod».Estes contos do fantástico-real (ou real-fantástico), integrando o humor e a sátira inconfundíveis de Gógol, tiveram grande influência no ulterior desenvolvimento da prosa literária russa e, também, no de todas as literaturas ocidentais. A modernidade das propostas de Gógol continua mais viva do que nunca nestas histórias em que a personagem principal é a cidade de Petersburgo: mesquinha, sufocante, ridícula, irrisória e ilusória.«O que é um facto é que o comprido e sensível nariz de Gógol descobriu novos odores na literatura (que conduziam a um novo frisson). Como diz o provérbio russo ""o homem que tem o nariz mais comprido vê mais longe""; e Gogol via com as narinas.

Living in the USA		Alison R. Lanier	3.54	24	0	{5: '5', 4: '6', 3: '10', 2: '3', 1: '0'}	As William Gay, distinguished adviser to the last edition of Living in the U.S.A., so aptly noted, the United States is a country that is never what you think it is. Since that edition was introduced nearly ten years ago, the country has been struggling with troubling, divisive events and issues, especially the September 11, 2001 attacks and the resulting War on Terror. Despite these extraordinary times, the United States still holds promise and opportunity for those who take the time to understand it.Jef Davis, a seasoned interculturalist and long-time adviser to international travelers, provides us a revised edition of Living in the U.S.A. that will guide you through the confusing, conflicted, exciting country and its diverse population. Part American cultural analysis, part practical relocation guide, this book will help you understand how general cultural traits will affect your daily interactions with Americans and give you a working vocabulary that will help you get around. Short-term visitors to the U.S. will learn how to survive customs and immigration, find an apartment, conduct business, obtain health care, and navigate the supermarket, bank, and post office. Long-term visitors will find practical pointers to get along at work, school, and at home; buy a house; make and keep American friends; and understand dominant American values in a diverse and complex society in the context of twenty-first century issues like the rise of religious fundamentalism and tensions between security and personal liberties.With new material and significantly updated chapters, Living in the U.S.A. is the perfect companion for those just visiting and immigrants alike.Comprehensive in its detail and attentive to the swirls of current events and attitudes, Living in the U.S.A. makes U.S. practices, habits and lifestyles understandable and navigable, even when uncomfortable for today's newcomers. It is local knowledge at its most digestible.-Dr. George F. Simons, George Simons International, www.diversophy.comLiving in the U.S.A. is a great book which helps us understand in great detail the American way of life, values, etc. It gives great clues/details about understanding the U.S. culture, and is very easy and interesting to read. I believe this will be an invaluable resource for me as I work with Americans and teach about Americans.

Now, noted historian David Oshinsky gives us the true story of the notorious prison, drawing on police records, prison documents, folklore, blues songs, and oral history, from the days of cotton-field chain gangs to the 1960s, when Parchman was used to break the wills of civil rights workers who journeyed south on Freedom Rides.	320	April 22nd 1997			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97610.Worse_Than_Slavery

Publicado pela primeira vez em 1962, seu público leitor só fez crescer desde então. O título - Para viver um grande amor - parece exercer sobre nós um grande fascínio. Vinicius de Moraes não decepciona seu leitor. E talvez devêssemos acrescentar: ele nunca nos decepciona, alçando-nos, ao contrário, além de nossas expectativas.Para viver um grande amor estrutura-se de modo singular: alterna poesia e prosa. As crônicas guardam as marcas típicas do gênero, como a observação aguda do cotidiano e a linguagem despojada. Mas, além disso, conforme o próprio Vinicius, ""há, para o leitor que se der ao trabalho de percorrê-las em sua integridade, uma unidade evidente que as enfeixa: a do grande amor"". Quanto aos poemas, encontram-se, aqui, exemplares de grande força expressiva, como o impactante ""Carta aos 'Puros'"". Os poemas não raro tomam para si a tarefa da crônica e, então, surgem experiências como os bem-humorados ""Feijoada à minha moda"" e ""Olhe aqui, Mr. Buster"" ou o seco e dramático ""Blues para Emmett Louis Till""."	222	1991			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/905049.Para_Viver_Um_Grande_Amor
One Robe, One Bowl: The Zen Poetry of Ryōkan		['Ryōkan', 'John   Stevens']	4.51	401	48	{5: '257', 4: '102', 3: '35', 2: '4', 1: '3'}	The hermit-monk Ryokan, long beloved in Japan both for his poetry and for his character, belongs in the tradition of the great Zen eccentrics of China and Japan. His reclusive life and celebration of nature and the natural life also bring to mind his younger American contemporary, Thoreau. Ryokan's poetry is that of the mature Zen master, its deceptive simplicity revealing an art that surpasses artifice. Although Ryokan was born in eighteenth-century Japan, his extraordinary poems, capturing in a few luminous phrases both the beauty and the pathos of human life, reach far beyond time and place to touch the springs of humanity.	96	2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/441023.One_Robe_One_Bowl

Letters and Sayings of Epicurus		Epicurus	4.04	203	16	{5: '73', 4: '80', 3: '37', 2: '12', 1: '1'}	Throughout the ages Epicurus has been both idealized and anathematized. As an atheist materialist philosopher he was an offense to religious thinkers. Many of his influential admirers, like Thomas Hobbes and Thomas Jefferson, had to keep their Epicurean leanings a secret. On the other hand, the philosopher-physicist Isaac Newton was candid enough to assert openly that he was reviving the tenets of the Epicurean philosophy when he embarked on his world-transforming project. Epicurus' significance transcends even his astounding historical influence because the subjects he reflected on - the purpose of life, the nature of reality, natural phenomena, and death - are of enduring significance.	100	December 31st 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2308993.Letters_and_Sayings_of_Epicurus

La prima racconta il viaggio in bicicletta di sette ragazzi triestini da Trieste a Cracovia, in dodici tappe. Al termine di ogni tappa, due anziani triestini, ispirati dagli avvenimenti accaduti ai ragazzi durante la giornata, raccontano al lettore un aneddoto dei loro tempi, sul modello delle famose Maldobrie di Carpinteri &amp; Faraguna. Questa doppia linea di narrazione permette al libro di presentare due tipi di dialetto, uno “più giovane”, usato nel ciclodiario in prima persona, e uno più “anziano”, usato nel raccontare gli aneddoti degli anziani in forma di dialogo. Uno degli obbiettivi del libro è infatti quello di voler illustrare l'evoluzione del dialetto triestino tra le diverse fasce di età della popolazione. Una terza parte è dedicata al fumetto, e vede protagonisti un gabbiano e una cornacchia che, parlandosi in dialetto, intervalleranno la narrazione con goffi tentativi di furto di cibo ai danni dei due anziani, usando nel loro vocabolario espressioni e modi di dire tipici della tradizione triestina.Il libro si è classificato al secondo posto nel Concorso Nazionale Salva la tua lingua locale, dedicato ai dialetti di tutta Italia.	218	May 8th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21523308-polska-rivemo

If he couldn't kill the past, Carmine St. Clair would live to punish himself for it and try to outrun it at the same time. Haunted by memories of a childhood stained with the so-called tough love of a God-lovin' alcoholic father and the inky residue of his own bigotry, the last 15 years are a blur of libations and amassing trophies, women and money. Carmine has spent his whole life distancing himself from his past, those crooked lines, the dusty red clay roads of the South. But when the winning streak ends and the phone rings, he ends up right back where he started: Eton, Georgia (population 318). When the walls he's built around himself crumble, Carmine finds love in everything he's tried to escape: a black woman, forgiveness, himself, and the past. As he tries to figure out what the past means, what it means to be good, and what the future holds, he'll have to decide between love and hate, darkness and light, and all the things in between. Sometimes you have to go back to where you started to learn the oldest lesson of all: you've got to let go of everything to gain it all. A story about love, about forgiveness, and about what it means to make a life worth living. Charming and deeply moving A Song for Carmine is a story that gives you something to leave with."	276	March 31st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21866357-a-song-for-carmine

Abba's Lament		Tina  Webb	4.00	8	4	{5: '3', 4: '3', 3: '1', 2: '1', 1: '0'}	"Daystar, chief of angels, leads Earth's occupation. When he hears that Abba plans to create yet another planet, his ambition grows selfish. Michael, governor of the province of Luz, also wants to lead the new planet and travels to Heaven to get permission. Abba consents. Feeling blindsided, Daystar turns against everyone he loves except beautiful Atara, whose fierce loyalty emboldens him to form a rogue army of rebel angels. Not even Abba, the Creator, conceives that Daystar could become so enchanted and deceived. Daystar appoints Atara to be his queen and together they seek to overtake Earth. As Luz burns from a surprise rebel attack, Michael and the other governors scour the earth to help angels who stand against the rebels. In Heaven, Abba issues an order that seals Daystar and Atara's fate. All around the globe, the rebels wreak havoc upon all that the angels had built. Michael's heart is broken. He knows his former friend is now eternally his enemy. Once a planet of promise, Earth convulses in its orbit as it turns into a burning wasteland. But Earth still has a future. Abba has a plan. This is Earth before Adam. This is the story of how evil became. ""a wondrous world...I've not read anything like it before."" (Heather S.)

A Primate's Memoir: A Neuroscientist's Unconventional Life Among the Baboons		Robert M. Sapolsky	4.36	6116	722	{5: '3331', 4: '1919', 3: '666', 2: '132', 1: '68'}	In the tradition of Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey, Robert Sapolsky, a foremost science writer and recipient of a MacArthur Genius Grant, tells the mesmerizing story of his twenty-one years in remote Kenya with a troop of Savannah baboons.“I had never planned to become a savanna baboon when I grew up; instead, I had always assumed I would become a mountain gorilla,” writes Robert Sapolsky in this witty and riveting chronicle of a scientist’s coming-of-age in remote Africa. An exhilarating account of Sapolsky’s twenty-one-year study of a troop of rambunctious baboons in Kenya, A Primate’s Memoir interweaves serious scientific observations with wry commentary about the challenges and pleasures of living in the wilds of the Serengeti — for man and beast alike. Over two decades, Sapolsky survives culinary atrocities, gunpoint encounters, and a surreal kidnapping, while witnessing the encroachment of the tourist mentality on the farthest vestiges of unspoiled Africa. As he conducts unprecedented physiological research on wild primates, he becomes evermore enamored of his subjects — unique and compelling characters in their own right — and he returns to them summer after summer, until tragedy finally prevents him.By turns hilarious and poignant, A Primate’s Memoir is a magnum opus from one of our foremost science writers.	304	March 12th 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32289.A_Primate_s_Memoir
And the Music Plays On		Eve M. Cooper	4.50	4	2		Miss Margaret, a matriarchal figure in a southern, small town church, is set in her ways and staunchly opposes change. Miss Margaret has been the Methodist church organist for almost 40 years and she truly loves the pipe organ she plays. In addition to valuing the tangible instrument, there is a deeper, more ethereal component to this situation. Miss Margaret uses the organ as a means of expression, one in which she pours her heart and soul into. After so many years of joined experience, she feels the organ actually contains a piece of her. Playing the old pipe organ has been a consistent source of joy the entire time she’s been the organist. Her beloved church has fallen into disrepair from years of haphazard neglect and a sect in the church advocates reconstruction using state of the art materials and technology. A rift forms between the church members who want to repair the church to its original state and the progressive sect who want to modernize as renovations take place. Decisions reach a crescendo when it is discovered that Miss Margaret’s cherished pipe organ needs complete restoration. It appears that progressive attitudes will prevail over the traditional frame of reference that the people in the town have historically lived by. Miss Margaret becomes painfully aware that times have changed while she seems to have been standing still. Will Miss Margaret carve a place for herself in a new modern church setting or will she oppose change and the possibility that time will march forward without her?	149	January 13th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20567178-and-the-music-plays-on

Notes from a Colored Girl: The Civil War Pocket Diaries of Emilie Frances Davis	Women's Diaries and Letters of the South	Karsonya Wise Whitehead	4.14	21	4	{5: '9', 4: '7', 3: '4', 2: '1', 1: '0'}	In Notes from a Colored Girl, Karsonya Wise Whitehead examines the life and experiences of Emilie Frances Davis, a freeborn twenty-one-year-old mulatto woman, through a close reading of three pocket diaries she kept from 1863 to 1865. Whitehead explores Davis's worldviews and politics, her perceptions of both public and private events, her personal relationships, and her place in Philadelphia's free black community in the nineteenth century. Although Davis's daily entries are sparse, brief snapshots of her life, Whitehead interprets them in ways that situate Davis in historical and literary contexts that illuminate nineteenth-century black American women's experiences. Whitehead's contribution of edited text and original narrative fills a void in scholarly documentation of women who dwelled in spaces between white elites, black entrepreneurs, and urban dwellers of every race and class.Notes from a Colored Girl is a unique offering to the fields of history and documentary editing as the book includes both a six-chapter historical reconstruction of Davis's life and a full, heavily annotated edition of her Civil War-era pocket diaries. Drawing on scholarly traditions from history, literature, feminist studies, and sociolinguistics, Whitehead investigates Davis's diary both as a complete literary artifact and in terms of her specific daily entries.From a historical perspective, Whitehead re-creates the narrative of Davis's life for those three years and analyzes the black community where she lived and worked. From a literary perspective, Whitehead examines Davis's diary as a socially, racially, and gendered nonfiction text. From a feminist studies perspective, she examines Davis's agency and identity, grounded in theories elaborated by black feminist scholars. And, from linguistic and rhetorical perspectives, she studies Davis's discourse about her interpersonal relationships, her work, and external events in her life in an effort to understand how she used language to construct her social, racial, and gendered identities.Since there are few primary sources written by black women during this time in history, Davis's diary--though ordinary in its content--is rendered extraordinary simply because it has survived to be included in this very small class of resources. Whitehead's extensive analysis illuminates the lives of many through the simple words of one. 	277	May 30th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18841647-notes-from-a-colored-girl

Carrier tells an engaging story of youth, redemption, and sexual coming of age in New Mexico. In 1971, seventeen-year-old Shane Russell makes a well-planned escape from a Michigan winter and sets off on a 2,000-mile adventure in search of a town that exists only between the covers of Richard Bradford’s famous New Mexico novel Red Sky at Morning (J.B. Lippincott, 1968). Driven to recreate the nude scenes and vivid characters in Bradford’s fictional town of Sagrado, Shane forever touches the lives of his widowed landlady, the detective hired to find him, and his new friends at a colorful high school deep in the Land of Enchantment.

Soon a mysterious trio arrives to take him away: the explorer Umber, the shy archer Sophie, and Oates, whose strength and honesty are both brutal. Hap and his new acquaintances narrowly escape the cavernous underworld and make their way to Lord Umber's bustling jewel of a harbor city, Kurahaven.  Once there, Hap learns that Lord Umber is an extraordinary man -- he's a merchant, adventurer, inventor, royal adviser, and chronicler of all things monstrous and magical.

Desperate to uncover clues in his new, baffling surroundings, Hap accompanies Umber on dangerous and unusual missions. But Hap soon learns that there are powerful enemies inside the kingdom, and a ruthless assassin is hot on his trail. Faced with many unknowns, Hap knows one thing is certain: There's a reason Umber has chosen him...if only he could determine it.  P. W.

Two Witnesses		Madison G. Blackwell	4.00	2	0		Before the age of humankind, and even before the age of dinosaurs, there was a time when dragons lived upon the earth. Quite different than we imagine them now, they had a civilized society, a social hierarchy, and a strong religious tradition. This religious culture, however, was oppressive and worshipped some of their own kind as gods. When a young dragon named Ogg hears of an ancient, hidden city that is the very definition of paradise, he defies the religious laws, embraces the life of a pariah, and sets off on his journey. Nothing he learned from his life in the villages of dragons could have prepared him for the radical liberation and enlightenment that awaits him on his journey. But these revelations will come at a price... The Two Witnesses is a Christian allegory with strong imagery, vivid characters, and an exotic mythology. The enlightening parallels between our modern world and the ancient one portrayed here are driven by its fast-paced storyline and vibrant settings. Glean spiritual wisdom and insight from this exciting tale told in an entirely new and wonderful way.	87	July 6th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8666973-two-witnesses
The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Anguttara Nikaya		Bhikkhu Bodhi	4.71	196	9	{5: '164', 4: '17', 3: '9', 2: '3', 1: '3'}	"Discover with the original teachings of the Buddha in this thorough translation of some of the oldest Buddhist texts in the world. Like the River Ganges flowing down from the Himalayas, the entire Buddhist tradition flows down to us from the teachings and deeds of the historical Buddha, who lived and taught in India during the fifth century B.C.E. To ensure that his legacy would survive the ravages of time, his direct disciples compiled records of the Buddha's teachings soon after his passing.In the Theravada Buddhist tradition, which prevails in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, these records are regarded as the definitive ""word of the Buddha."" Preserved in Pali, an ancient Indian language closely related to the language that the Buddha spoke, this full compilation of texts is known as the Pali Canon. At the heart of the Buddha's teaching were the suttas (Sanskrit sutras), his discourses and dialogues. If we want to find out what the Buddha himself actually said, these are the most ancient sources available to us. The suttas were compiled into collections called ""Nikayas,"" of which there are four, each organized according to a different principle. The Digha Nikaya consists of longer discourses; the Majjhima Nikaya of middle-length discourses; the Samyutta Nikaya of thematically connected discourses; and the Anguttara Nikaya of numerically patterned discourses. The Numerical Discourses  contains a full translation of the Anguttara Nikaya. The Anguttara arranges the Buddha's discourses in accordance with a numerical scheme intended to promote retention and easy comprehension. In an age when writing was still in its infancy, this proved to be the most effective way to ensure that the disciples could grasp and replicate the structure of a teaching.Here’s what makes the Numerical Discourses special:Insightful commentary from eminent scholar-monk Bhikkhu Bodhi Its comprehensive translation of the Anguttara Nikaya, part of the Pali Canon Teachings specifically for lay people and families Themes including family life, right livelihood, friendship, and meditation techniques laid out in a carefully organized thematic guide In 2013, Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi was awarded the 2013 Khyentse Foundation Prize for Outstanding Translation.Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation and compilation also includes a useful thematic guide to the Anguttara Nikaya, so that readers can browse the volume by topic. Find the teachings to further your practice and bring clarity to your life today by diving into this rich treasure of the Buddhist literary tradition. With this volume, readers can learn about the life of the Buddha, instructions for maintaining a harmonious household, monastic practice and lifestyle, meditation practice, and the Sangha (Buddhist community)."	1944	October 16th 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13594969-the-numerical-discourses-of-the-buddha

Searching for Amber		David        Smith	4.40	20	14	{5: '11', 4: '6', 3: '3', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	When Jade, a passionate young photographer, is attacked by drug pushers and saved by the brooding shipwright Martin, she becomes increasingly obsessed with her reluctant hero’s tragic back-story. Her pursuit of Martin’s affection and her consequent obsessive search for Martin’s lost sister, Amber, ultimately leads Jade to discover the truth about her own mother, who abandoned her as a baby in the late 1950s, and the tragic events that led to her disappearance. The inner lives of the main characters, their friends and the forces of sea and storm that confound them, unfold and intertwine over three distinct time periods; 1950s Aldeburgh, late 1970/80s Suffolk, and 1990s London and Essex, where they eventually reunite. Searching for Amber is an engaging exploration of love, violence, betrayal and loss, told through beautiful writing, natural imagery and poetry. It is a story that takes into its sweep the breathtaking seascapes of Britten’s Suffolk, the rural idyll of Coggeshall and its Martyrs, and the brash vibrancy of Thatcher’s London. In creating this lyrical tale, David Smith has been inspired by Benjamin Britten’s Four Sea Interludes, Graham Greene’s Brighton Rock and Shakespeare’s The Tempest, as well as his memories of romantic weekends spent in Aldeburgh with his wife.

But there's just one thing... if you die in the game, you die in real life.In The Passage, Kino meets Axel and the others that will be part of her team. But she is different. Kino is covering up something more than a slight mutation in her eyes. Something that she will discover that can change not just her body, but her life and also the lives of everyone in the world.KINO:''The Passage is not anything more than that; a test. And it depends on the score that you ended the Passage with, whether they give you a job or they let you study at the university of Lumen, or if not, you end up being an erotic ballerina or an escort to someone who bought you to avoid your almost certain death in Zone Four. Despite how weird, dirty, and ugly it sounded to have hopes of being acquired by a man, the majority of girls from Zero were anxious for that moment. It was like everyone's fairytale. But, instead of being saved by a prince, it was being bought by one.''	280	January 16th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22398187-the-passage

Thrown Away: the Walking Papers		Eufrain McPoonin	5.00	1	1		"In 1992, Jeffrey McPoe plummets below the 40-50 feet deep cliff with his car, one heart-pounding event ahead of his disaster. As the investigator himself, it turned the other way around; he has just become the interrogated guy and the embassy's object of investigation. As the probe tracks his frantic race toward proving his innocence, he is tormented by mad visions and by the knowledge that his time in the embassy is running out, determined to fight back for his vindication. Responding to little more than the primitive quest for justice at any cost, he retreats ever deeper into the cradle of his own government, one which never has eyes glowed bright green in the headlight, and bares no fangs to bite for his case. ""Thrown Away"" takes you on a journey of investigation and an avowed loyalty of one of the Consular Investigators of the U.S. Embassy of two and a half decades."	122	June 4th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22437126-thrown-away

With his trademark wit and heart, he outlines the absurdities and challenges that come with growing old, from insomnia to memory loss to leaving dinners with half your meal on your shirt. In humorous chapters like “Buying the Plot” and “Nodding Off,” Crystal not only catalogues his physical gripes, but offers a road map to his 77 million fellow baby boomers who are arriving at this milestone age with him. He also looks back at the most powerful and memorable moments of his long and storied life, from entertaining his relatives as a kid in Long Beach, Long Island, his years doing stand-up in the Village, up through his legendary stint at Saturday Night Live, When Harry Met Sally, and his long run as host of the Academy Awards. Readers get a front-row seat to his one-day career with the New York Yankees (he was the first player to ever “test positive for Maalox”), his love affair with Sophia Loren, and his enduring friendships with several of his idols, including Mickey Mantle and Muhammad Ali. He lends a light touch to more serious topics like religion (“the aging friends I know have turned to the Holy Trinity: Advil, bourbon, and Prozac”), grandparenting, and, of course, dentistry. As wise and poignant as they are funny, Crystal’s reflections are an unforgettable look at an extraordinary life well lived. 	288	September 10th 2013	['Billy Crystal']		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15902792-still-foolin-em

Madame is an unexpected gem: a novel about Poland during the grim years of Soviet-controlled mediocrity, which nonetheless sparkles with light and warmth.Our young narrator-hero is suffering through the regulated boredom of high school when he is transfixed by a new teacher --an elegant ""older woman"" (she is thirty-two) who bewitches him with her glacial beauty and her strict intelligence. He resolves to learn everything he can about her and to win her heart.In a sequence of marvelously funny but sobering maneuvers, he learns much more than he expected to--about politics, Poland, the Spanish Civil War, and his own passion for theater and art--all while his loved one continues to elude him. Yet without his realizing it, his efforts--largely bookish and literary--to close in on Madame are his first steps to liberation as an artist. Later, during a stint as a teacher-in-training in his old school, he discovers that he himself has become a legendary figure to a new generation of students, and he begins to understand the deceits and blessings of myth, and its redemptive power.A winning portrait of an artist as a young man, Madame is at the same time a moving, engaging novel about strength and weakness, first love, and the efforts we make to reconcile, in art, the opposing forces of reason and passion."	448	May 26th 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/368405.Madame

Ruth Plank is an artist and a romantic with a rich, passionate, imaginative life. The last of five girls born to a gentle, caring farmer and his stolid wife, she yearns to soar beyond the confines of the land that has been her family's birthright for generations. Dana Dickerson is a scientist and realist whose faith is firmly planted in the natural world. Raised by a pair of capricious drifters who waste their lives on failed dreams, she longs for stability and rootedness. Different in nearly every way, Ruth and Dana share a need to make sense of who they are and to find their places in a world in which neither has ever truly felt she belonged. They also share a love for Dana's wild and beautiful older brother, Ray, who will leave an indelible mark on both their hearts. Told in the alternating voices of Ruth and Dana, The Good Daughters follows these ""birthday sisters"" as they make their way from the 1950s to the present. Master storyteller Joyce Maynard chronicles the unlikely ways the two women's lives parallel and intersect—from childhood and adolescence to first loves, first sex, marriage, and parenthood; from the deaths of parents to divorce, the loss of home, and the loss of a beloved partner—until past secrets and forgotten memories unexpectedly come to light, forcing them to reevaluate themselves and each other. Moving from rural New Hampshire to a remote island in British Columbia to the '70s Boston art-school scene, The Good Daughters is an unforgettable story about the ties of home and family, the devastating force of love, the healing power of forgiveness, and the desire to know who we are."	288	August 24th 2010		['New Hampshire', 'British Columbia']	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8134469-the-good-daughters

Entre ellos, sir Alex Ferguson que, pese a perder dos finales de la Liga de Campeones contra el Barcelona, admira a Guardiola. Cómo es el hombre que consiguió un número extraordinario de títulos y cuál era su verdadera relación con los miembros clave de su entorno durante los maravillosos cuatro años en que estuvo a cargo del mejor equipo de la historia. Sin embargo, para Pep el triunfo iba acompañado de cierto drama personal: cada partido era uno menos en la élite, nunca se sintió lo suficientemente bueno en su trabajo, sus disputas con Mourinho le hicieron daño y padecía enormemente tomando decisiones hasta que dio por terminado el ciclo más exitoso del fútbol moderno para tomarse un año sabático antes de su esperado regreso al frente del Bayern Munich.

The book charts the progress of a love affair from the first kiss to argument and reconciliation, from intimacy and tenderness to the onset of anxiety and heartbreak.

While gripping the reader with the talent of a great novelist, de Botton brings a philosopher’s sensibility to his analysis of the emotions of love, resulting in a genre-breaking book that is at once touching and thought-provoking.	211	January 1st 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23426.On_Love

Bila bicara cinta di antara lawan jenis, satu-satunya jalan adalah dengan pernikahan, yang dengannya cinta menjadi halal dan penuh keberkahan. Sebaliknya, Islam melarang keras segala jenis interaksi cinta yang tiada halal. Bukan karena apa pun, tapi karena Islam adalah agama yang memuliakan manusia dan mencegah kerusakan-kerusakan yang akan terjadi pada diri manusia itu sendiri.Sialnya, kaum Muslim kini hidup dalam kungkungan masyarakat yang sebagian besar salah kaprah dalam cinta. Karenanya tidak dikenal lagi kesakralan pernikahan dan kesucian diri, apalagi kehormatan dan kemuliaan jiwa. Semua sudah terganti dengan pergaulan bebas, ada yang menyebutnya pacaran, teman tapi mesra, dibalut dalam alasan kakak-adik, teman dekat, ataupun yang lainnya.#UdahPutusinAja, sebab apa pun namanya, kelak akan bersaksi seluruh bagian tubuh di depan Allah. Karenanya, sedari dini mari mendidik cinta, mengajarinya agar ia bersemi dalam taat, bukan direndahkan oleh maksiat. Ajarkan cinta agar ia benar hingga membuat pemiliknya terhormat, bukan nista yang ditanggung karena terbuai cinta yang terlaknat.	180	February 14th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17375790-udah-putusin-aja
The New Codependency: Help and Guidance for Today's Generation		Melody Beattie	3.93	1393	135	{5: '486', 4: '467', 3: '311', 2: '108', 1: '21'}	"In ""Codependent No More, "" Melody Beattie introduced the world to the term ""codependency."" Now a modern classic, this book established Beattie as a pioneer in self-help literature and endeared her to millions of readers who longed for healthier relationships. Twenty-five years later concepts such as self-care and setting boundaries have become entrenched in mainstream culture. Now Beattie has written a followup volume, ""The New Codependency, "" which clears up misconceptions about codependency, identifies how codependent behavior has changed, and provides a new generation with a road map to wellness.The question remains: What is and what is not codependency? Beattie here reminds us that much of codependency is normal behavior. It's about crossing lines. There are times we do too much, care too much, feel too little, or overly engage. Feeling resentment after giving is not the same as heartfelt generosity. Narcissism and self-love, enabling and nurturing, and controlling and setting boundaries are not interchangeable terms. In ""The New Codependency, "" Beattie explores these differences, effectively invoking her own inspiring story and those of others, to empower us to step out of the victim role forever. Codependency, she shows, is not an illness but rather a series of behaviors that once broken down and analyzed can be successfully combated.Each section offers an overview of and a series of activities pertaining to a particular behavior -- caretaking, controlling, manipulation, denial, repression, etc. -- enabling us to personalize our own step-bystep guide to wellness. These sections, in conjunction with a series of tests allowing us to assess the level of our codependent behavior, demonstrate that while it may not seem possible now, we have the power to take care of ourselves, no matter what we are experiencing.Punctuated with Beattie's renowned candor and intuitive wisdom, ""The New Codependency"" is an owner's manual to learning to be who we are and gives us the tools necessary to reclaim our lives by renouncing unhealthy practices."	288	December 1st 2008			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5988850-the-new-codependency

Keeping a secret like that isn’t easy, but a small town is the perfect place for her to heal those who can’t heal themselves, and an even better place for her father, James Fairmont, to hide his daughter from the rest of the world. Life takes an unexpected turn when two handsome strangers move into town and begin unearthing other secrets concerning Hope's future and past, revealing to Hope that her gift for healing may be the fulfillment of an ancient, Japanese prophecy gone wrong. Staying away from these mysterious newcomers would be the smart thing to do, but Victor's gentle, easy manner, and Tie's mixed signals and strange mood swings draw her hopelessly closer to revealing the secret she and her father have been so desperate to hide. Hope's life is complicated further with visions of a previous life and the arrival of a supernatural demon sent to assassinate her before she learns what she is truly capable of. With the support of her father, the fiery loyalty of her best friend Angie, and the child-like love of Kirby, a ten-year-old patient, Hope must fight against the forces of a relentless demon god while unwinding the tangled pieces of her past, proving to herself and those she loves that destiny isn’t determined by some cosmic reading of the stars, but by the individual choices one makes.	265	May 31st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22393715-the-healer

Water and Life		Kaltoum Belhassan	4.25	4	4		Water exists in many places in the universe and may be the principal element for life on Earth's surface. Its presence is a hallmark of the habitable zones for living things (humans, animals, and plants). About 70 percent of Earth's surface is covered with water, but only about 1 percent of the water on Earth's surface is usable by living things (groundwater and surface water). Water has several properties that make it unique among compounds and make it possible for all forms of known life to function. Water is a uniquely wonderful substance on Earth that naturally occurs in three different states: solid, liquid, and gaseous. All living things depend on water. When water resources are polluted, all forms of life are threatened. Water scarcity is a function of cultural activities and human civilization. It is very important to highlight water's pivotal role as the essential ingredient for life and to develop a comprehensive framework for creating water-resource policies to manage water resources. This book includes photographs of water and life to demonstrate to the reader water's properties and water's effects on life.	182	May 7th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22525680-water-and-life

Revolutionary, Alex Myers’s richly imagined and meticulously researched debut novel, brings the true story of Deborah’s struggle against a rigid colonial society back to life--and with it the courage, hope, fear, and heartbreak that shaped her journey through a country’s violent birth.After years as an indentured servant in a sleepy Massachusetts town, chafing under the oppressive norms of colonial America, Deborah can’t contain her discontent any longer. When a sudden crisis forces her hand, she decides to finally make her escape. Embracing the peril and promise of the unknown, she cuts her hair, binds her chest, and, stealing clothes from a neighbor, rechristens herself Robert Shurtliff. It’s a desperate, dangerous, and complicated deception, and becomes only more so when, as Robert, she enlists in the Continental Army.What follows is an inspiring, one-of-a-kind journey through an America torn apart by war: brutal winters and lethal battlefields, the trauma of combat and the cruelty of betrayal, the joy of true love and the tragedy of heartbreak. In his brilliant Revolutionary, Myers, who is a descendant of the historical Deborah, takes full advantage of this real-life heroine’s unique voice to celebrate the struggles for freedom, large and small, like never before."	320	January 14th 2014			https://gc.kis.v2.scr.kaspersky-labs.com/E3E8934C-235A-4B0E-825A-35A08381A191/abn/main.css?attr=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZHJlYWRzLmNvbS9ib29rL3Nob3cvMTc1NzE1NjktcmV2b2x1dGlvbmFyeQ

Čia ne tik vaizdžiai piešiami ryškūs kultūrų skirtumai, bet taip pat ieškoma jas siejančių paralelių, pasireiškiančių žmogaus santykiuose su gamta, antgamtinėmis būtybėmis, mirtimi, dievais ir pačiu savimi. Antrojoje dalyje – „Pastabos ant bilietų skiaučių“ – su humoru ir autoironija pateikiamos pikantiškos kelionių detalės, netikėti ir komiški tolimų šalių rakursai, kartkartėmis sugrįžtant į Lietuvą su visomis jos ganėtinai absurdiškomis grimasomis. Pastabas, kurias tikriausiai būtų galima pavadinti „antituristinėmis“, keičia autobiografiniai išsipasakojimai ir šmaikštūs pasvarstymai apie donžuanus, kazanovas, elnius, ateivius iš kitų planetų ar lietuviškąjį elitą.Trečiojoje dalyje – „Kelionės į save“ – plėtojamas teiginys, kad keliaudami mes ne tik pažįstame pasaulį ir atrandame dar nematytas šalis, bet taip pat atveriame paslėptas savo sielos vietoves. Tos „vietovės“ – įvairios: sapnai, tikėjimas ir skirtingų religijų dialogas, dogmų ir tabu įveikimas, nuodėmė ir atleidimas, pasiruošimas mirčiai, pamąstymai apie angelus sargus ar Žemės gyventojų sudėtį ir t. t. Dauguma šio skyriaus esė buvo spausdinta „Lietuvos ryte“, penktadienio priede „Savaitgalis“.Knyga Kelionių alchemija tam tikra prasme pratęsia ir papildo J. Ivanauskaitės „Tibetietiškąją trilogiją“, tačiau dabartinis jos temų ratas – kur kas platesnis, užgriebiantis ne tik tolimiausius egzotiškus kraštus, bet ir Lietuvos aktualijas.	320	2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1425895.Kelioni_alchemija

The Dude Who Did Dictionaries		Josh Mitchell	3.13	8	5	{5: '3', 4: '1', 3: '1', 2: '0', 1: '3'}	"Frank Flutie is a lexicographer who has waged war on the ""perils of adultolescence"" by leaving a high-paying job as a copywriter for an advertising company called The Banker and taking a low-paying job in a bookstore instead, ostensibly so he can write the first ever all sexual dictionary. The ""war"" (and his dictionary), however, aren't going particularly well and, under the stress of his ""self-imposed exile"" from affluence, Frank has become petty and fatalistic -- ""a shit hoarder whose dictionary would be better utilized as a flyswatter, a doorstop, or a paperweight"". Always broke, but too proud to accept charity, he rarely sees his few friends and cannot get the virginal Marlene in bed because (or so he believes), ""If you got no dough, no woman will love you."" On the mantle in Frank's shabby apartment is a sickly but unkillable pet sea lamprey -- a jawless fish he abhors as the banner of the sort of ""clockwork universe"" he is fleeing from in his downward spiral. In the course of his misadventures, we become grindingly aware that his radical solution to the problem of the money-world is no solution at all -- that in his desperate reaction against a monstrous system, he has become something of a monster himself."	141	July 21st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22772589-the-dude-who-did-dictionaries

All We Had		Annie Weatherwax	3.75	1964	284	{5: '418', 4: '809', 3: '594', 2: '115', 1: '28'}	A poignant and fierce debut novel about the relationship between a teenage daughter and her struggling single mother—from a powerful new voice in fiction.For Ruthie Carmichael and her mother Rita, life has never been stable. Jobs are hard to find, men come and go. But when a set of unexpected circumstances strands them in Fat River, a small rural town in upstate New York, life takes a turn. Fat River becomes the first place they call home. The modest economic security they gain gives them peace and space for friends. The people of Fat River—Hank and Dotty Hanson, the elderly owners of the local hardware store being driven out of business by the new Walmart; Mel, the flawed, but kindhearted owner of the town diner where Rita finds work; and the cross-dressing Peter Pam, the novel’s voice of warmth and reason—become family. Into this quirky utopia comes Vick Ward, a smooth-talking broker who entices Rita with a subprime mortgage and urges her to buy the ramshackle house she and her daughter have been renting.  Tough and quick-witted, thirteen-year-old Ruthie—whose sardonic voice and plain-spoken observations infuse All We Had with disarming honesty and humor—never minded her hardscrabble existence as long as her mother was by her side. Through it all, the two have always been the center of one another’s lives. But when financial crisis hits, their luck takes a different turn. All We Had offers an unflinching look at the devastating choices a mother must make to survive and is an achingly funny, heart wrenching tale about love and loss, told with humor and razor sharp vision	272	August 5th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18775258-all-we-had

Kicking the Sky		Anthony De Sa	3.55	563	117	{5: '99', 4: '202', 3: '188', 2: '58', 1: '16'}	On a steamy summer day in 1977, Emanuel Jaques was shining shoes in downtown Toronto. Surrounded by the strip clubs, bars and body rub parlors of Yonge Street, Emanuel was lured away from his friends by a man who promised some easy money. Four days later the boy's body was discovered. He had been brutally raped and murdered, and Toronto the Good would never be the same. The murder of the Shoeshine Boy had particularly tragic resonance for the city's Portuguese community. The loss of one of their own symbolized for many how far they were from realizing their immigrant dreams. Kicking the Sky is told from the perspective of one of these children, Antonio Rebelo, a character first introduced in Barnacle Love. Twelve-year-old Antonio prizes his life of freedom and adventure. He and his best friends, Manny and Ricky, spend their days on their bikes exploring the labyrinth of laneways that link their Portuguese neighborhood to the rest of the city. But as the details of Emanuel's death expose Toronto's seedier underbelly, the boys are pulled into an adult world of danger and cruelty, secrets and lies much closer to home. Kicking the Sky is a novel driven by dramatic events, taking hold of readers from its opening pages, intensifying its force towards an ending of huge emotional impact.	336	September 10th 2013		['Toronto, Ontario']	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15792510-kicking-the-sky

Sleepeth Not, the Bastard		Dave Matthes	4.61	18	7	{5: '11', 4: '7', 3: '0', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	"""The gravity of fate is nothing in comparison to the fleeting warmth of a loved one's last kiss...""....thus reads the final words of High School Senior Joshua Feranna. Several years later, Lew, his father, currently working for a faceless loan shark, has dipped into a drug and lust-filled method of cope. Separated but not divorced, his wife Autumn finally tracks Lew down, begging him to come home to help take care of their identity-in-crisis daughter Zoey. But when Lew's friend from high school, Sarah Fox, having lived the life of a drummer in the all-but extinct rock band ""The Bastards"" returns to town stalked by a rumored ""Resurrection Tour"", Lew's world truly becomes a thing of legend....and doubt. What transpires from then on is a continuing snowball effect that will inevitably lead to the cataclysmic destruction of one family and others as the world continues to busy itself around them in seamless melancholy. ""Sleepeth Not, the Bastard"" is a story about people, each one steadily climbing towards a foreseeable yet undeniable end. Each person influencing the other in one massive string of events escalating and culminating at the end of their respective worlds whether those worlds be of mental, emotional, psychological, or delusional origin.Part drama, part dark comedy, part rock 'n roll epic, with a copious and perhaps endless helping of sex, drugs, and infamy... ""Sleepeth Not, the Bastard"" is a romp for this generation, an homage to those that came before, and a warning for those that follow."	450	October 1st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36215981-sleepeth-not-the-bastard

Journey To  Healing and Wholeness		Paul Halbeck	4.17	6	4	{5: '2', 4: '3', 3: '1', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	"This is written as a ""healing journey,"" not just as a book on healing, I think you will find it to be much broader in its scope than that. For I am writing this not just from academic knowledge, but as I write it, I am also going through this same journey to receive my healing.The book will guide the reader through the Word of God in a logical progression of steps, making the reader aware of the power behind the Word, for Jesus came to give us life and life more abundantly, John 10:10. God's Word is able to meet all of our needs if we but let His Word work in our lives, for we are generally the one's that limit the Word from working. The Word can heal us both emotional, physically and bring us into a closer and a deeper relationship with Him.If the world that we live in was actually created by God's Word, (Jesus), John 1:3, then God's Word is the parent force of all creation. Scripture goes on to say, all things were created by Him and for Him, Colossians 1:16; thus Jesus had a purpose for creating His creation. If these two scriptures are true, then it would be to our benefit to learn about this Man Jesus Christ and His Word. If our focus remains on the Word, we will then be lead into that abundant life, that Jesus came to give us, rather than just settling for what the world can give us.The manuscript addresses many relevant topics in every day language concerning God's Word. There are many short and concise chapter topics, as shown in the table of contents: * IntroductionBeginning mind-sets: * God's Word the healing power  * Knowing that God is your Father  * Realizing that God is a good God  * Knowing God's love for you  * Knowing that God wants you well  * Having a strong desire to get well  * Leaving your past hurts in the past  * Will you receive God forgiveness? * You are worthy of God's healing  * Letting God's Word become real  * Desiring a closer walk with Him  * Having a thankful heart  * It will be done according to your faith  * A living God and His living Word  * Do not disqualify My people Pursuing every healing path possible: * Jesus took our infirmities  * Imagination and hope, a primary step  * What scriptures are you standing on  * Speaking life instead of death  * Speaking God's Word over your body  * Are you willing to be carried?  * Will you accept His free gift of healing  * Having the elders pray over you  * Asking others for a prayer of agreement  * Participating in Holy Communion  * Praise and worship, a powerful tool  * Healed by the spirit within us  * Walking in the authority as a son of God  * Having the Lord rebuke the devourer Biblical healing philosophies: * It's all about what Jesus accomplished  * Making the commitment to succeed  * It's a spiritual battle not a physical one  * Not quitting before the war is over  * As a man thinks in his heart so is he * Making God's Word your life source  * Living out of the spirit and not the flesh  * Natural healing vs. divine healing  * Healing vs. walking in wholeness  * Healing and wholeness, in this lifetime  * Becoming poor in spirit  * When you have done all, keep standing  * OK, I am standing, now what? The Journey Continues: * Be prepared to go it alone  * Allowing God's kingdom to reign within  * Divine healing comes by spiritual things  * Closing comments  * Epilogue"	224	July 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22886742-journey-to-healing-and-wholeness

Those who turn to poetry to become confidants for another's stories and secrets will not be disappointed.”—Publishers Weekly“In her fifth book of poetry, Bass addresses everything from Saturn’s rings and Newton’s law of gravitation to wasps and Pablo Neruda. Her words are nostalgic, vivid, and visceral. Bass arrives at the truth of human carnality rooted in the extraordinary need and promise of the individual. Bass shows us that we are as radiant as we are ephemeral, that in transience glistens resilient history and the remarkable fluidity of connection. By the collection’s end—following her musings on suicide and generosity, desire and repetition—it becomes lucidly clear that Bass is not only a poet but also a philosopher and a storyteller.”—BooklistEllen Bass brings a deft touch as she continues her ongoing interrogations of crucial moral issues of our times, while simultaneously delighting in endearing human absurdities. From the start of Like a Beggar, Bass asks her readers to relax, even though ""bad things are going to happen,"" because the ""bad"" gets mined for all manner of goodness.From ""Another Story"":After dinner, we're drinking scotch at the kitchen table.Janet and I just watched a NOVA specialand we're explaining to her motherthe age and size of the universe—the hundred billion stars in the hundred billion galaxies.Dotty lives at Dominican Oaks, making her way down the long hall.How about the sun? she asks, a little farmshit in the endlessness.I gather up a cantaloupe, a lime, a cherry,and start revolving this salad around the chicken carcass.This is the best scotch I ever tasted, Dotty says,even though we gave her the Maker's Markwhile we're drinking Glendronach...Ellen Bass's poetry includes  Like A Beggar (Copper Canyon Press, 2014), The Human Line  (Copper Canyon Press, 2007), which was named a Notable Book by the San Francisco Chronicle, and Mules of Love (BOA, 2002), which won the Lambda Literary Award.  She co-edited (with Florence Howe) the groundbreaking No More Masks!

Wordsworth, his sidekick Savant Poe and a motley crew of villagers venture into the wood to see what damage has been done.To their amazed befuddlement, right in the centre of the seared earth is a giant mound of molten toffee and within it, a selection of human remains.Ænus P. Wordsworth takes it upon himself to find out who these bones belong to and how they came to be there. In doing so, he uncovers a horrific tale of murder, incest and cannibalism that spreads throughout the neighbouring villages that surround Phooka Wood.Their investigation takes them to all corners of their roundabout world; from Mortal End to the oozing Hamlet of Stifle and Little Napoo. Along their colourful journey, we are introduced to a larger than life cast from Doc Sheare the barber surgeon, Verrye Brutall the handsome woodsman, Beliala Bigswoln the publican’s daughter, Baron Rubigo Bluebeard and Umbra the Bogyman.Everyone seems to have a secret that they are trying to hide that could give clues to the horror of Phooka Wood. Even Ænus P. Wordsworth has something to hide!""Why does guilt hang heavy in this village like offal in a stew? What secret has the God-fearing Ænus P. Wordsworth kept so carefully? Where have all the children gone? These and many other questions will be answered when you read Mortal End.What readers are saying about Mortal End: A Simmering Pit of Jiggery Pokery:""It's a smidge of Dickens, shaken but not stirred with ""A League of Gentlemen"", sort of starcrossed with a bit of Neil Gaiman, plus a soupcon of Terry Pratchett. And totally and utterly your own!”“Mortal End is the funniest and most disturbing adult fairytale ever written.”""My imagination is being flooded with the most enormous canvas of human depravity… and I am finding that it fills me with delight.”""Despite it's subject matter it is light-hearted in it's delivery and the clever way the writer expresses herself is a joy to behold.""""Love the incredibly clever mind of Toula Mavridou-Messer. Excited to read her next book as well!”""Love the prose, the most colourful, creepy, characters in their deliciously rancid world.""""Toula's imagination knows no bounds. Her characters are original and fascinating and leap off the page. She is a smart writer with the ability to make a story exciting and mysterious and will take your breath away."" - LA WRITERS CENTERMortal End: A Simmering Pit Of Jiggery Pokery, the debut novel from Toula Mavridou-Messer, was written in the space of three weeks after two car crashes in just one hour. Even the rescue serviceman who came to collect her from the mangled wreckage was hesitant about transporting her, saying, ""Things happen in threes, don't they?""""It's a sign,"" thought Toula, as those crashes came during the return journey from a residential crime writing course she attended, given by best-selling author Val McDermid. She had been battling a major problem faced by so many would-be authors - that of actually finishing a project and then doing something with it.Facing death head on seems to have been the antidote, although not necessarily recommended as a remedy for all. Every time Toula was faced with either a blank page or the option of walking away from the type-writer, she remembered that she had been spared a fate worse than death...or in fact, death and that small fact kept her chained to her desk.Fortunately she saw the funny side and hopefully so will you when you read Mortal End: A Simmering Pit Of Jiggery Pokery, available from Amazon, Kindle and Barnes &amp; Noble."	178	July 28th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23566472-mortal-end

In the State I'm In	Retimer #3	Michael Angliss	5.00	6	2	{5: '6', 4: '0', 3: '0', 2: '0', 1: '0'}	In Canberra, Australia the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany has been terror-bombed twice, and twice very successfully… The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation’s (ASIO’s) best secret agent, Luthan Fennes—aka the ‘Retimer’, who ‘has his lifetimes again’, so to speak—is called in to investigate what, at first, seems the reprisal by human traffickers against Police raids recently on corrupt embassy staff accepting bribes for European Union travel visas. But it soon becomes a tug-of-war between two great old-war foes on the world stage…with Fennes both in the midst of it all, and as the key to ending the crisis before one of the sides can go much too far—nuclear with the help of its rogue satellite state, North Korea…	263	September 1st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21485561-in-the-state-i-m-in
Blackfoot Physics: A Journey into the Native American Worldview		F. David Peat	4.23	138	19	{5: '67', 4: '45', 3: '18', 2: '7', 1: '1'}	One summer in the 1980s, theoretical physicist F. David Peat went to a Blackfoot Sun Dance ceremony. Having spent all of his life steeped in and influenced by linear Western science, he was entranced by the Native American worldview and, through dialogue circles between scientists and native elders, he began to explore it in greater depth. Blackfoot Physics is the account of his discoveries. In an edifying synthesis of anthropology, history, metaphysics, cosmology, and quantum theory, Peat compares the medicines, the myths, the languages--the entire perceptions of reality of the Western and indigenous peoples. What becomes apparent is the amazing resemblance between indigenous teachings and some of the insights that are emerging from modern science, a congruence that is as enlightening about the physical universe as it is about the circular evolution of humanity's understanding. Through Peat's insightful observations, he extends our understanding of ourselves, our understanding of the universe, and how the two intersect in a meaningful vision of human life in relation to a greater reality.	352	December 23rd 2005			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/110248.Blackfoot_Physics

It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fulness of the everlasting gospel. The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are the principal ancestors of the American Indians. The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come. After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glorified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the English language. In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God"""	0	February 25th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10607462-the-lds-scriptures

The second chapter considers the way in which the West was seen at the time by residents of Central and Eastern Europe, while the third outlines the practice of Ketman, the act of paying lip service to authority while concealing personal opposition, describing seven forms applied in the people's democracies of mid-20th century Europe.The four chapters at the heart of the book then follow, each a portrayal of a gifted Polish man who capitulated, in some fashion, to the demands of the Communist state. They are identified only as Alpha, the Moralist; Beta, The Disappointed Lover; Gamma, the Slave of History; and Delta, the Troubadour. However, each of the four portraits were easily identifiable: Alpha is Jerzy Andrzejewski, Beta is Tadeusz Borowski, Gamma is Jerzy Putrament and Delta is Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński.The book moves toward its climax with an elaboration of ""enslavement through consciousness"" in the penultimate chapter and closes with a pained and personal assessment of the fate of the Baltic nations in particular."	272	August 11th 1990			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145660.The_Captive_Mind

Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure		Samira Kawash	3.73	321	64	{5: '60', 4: '135', 3: '108', 2: '16', 1: '2'}	"For most Americans, candy is an uneasy pleasure, eaten with side helpings of guilt and worry. Yet candy accounts for only 6 percent of the added sugar in the American diet. And at least it's honest about what it is—a processed food, eaten for pleasure, with no particular nutritional benefit. So why is candy considered especially harmful, when it's not so different from the other processed foods, from sports bars to fruit snacks, that line supermarket shelves? How did our definitions of food and candy come to be so muddled? And how did candy come to be the scapegoat for our fears about the dangers of food?In Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure, Samira Kawash tells the fascinating story of how candy evolved from a luxury good to a cheap, everyday snack. After candy making was revolutionized in the early decades of mass production, it was celebrated as a new kind of food for energy and enjoyment. Riding the rise in snacking and exploiting early nutritional science, candy was the first of the panoply of ""junk foods"" that would take over the American diet in the decades after the Second World War—convenient and pleasurable, for eating anytime or all the time.And yet, food reformers and moral crusaders have always attacked candy, blaming it for poisoning, alcoholism, sexual depravity and fatal disease. These charges have been disproven and forgotten, but the mistrust of candy they produced has never diminished. The anxiety and confusion that most Americans have about their diets today is a legacy of the tumultuous story of candy, the most loved and loathed of processed foods.Candy is an essential, addictive read for anyone who loves lively cultural history, who cares about food, and who wouldn't mind feeling a bit better about eating a few jelly beans."	416	October 15th 2013			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17731595-candy

McAfee	4.36	89	13	{5: '51', 4: '25', 3: '9', 2: '2', 1: '2'}	Hailed as the Catch-22 of the Vietnam War, Slow Walk in a Sad Rain is based on the author's own experiences as a combat Green Beret. This poignant, darkly comic debut novel establishes John P. McAfee as an extraordinary new voice in wartime fiction.The story begins in Special Forces A Camp, number 413, twenty miles from the Cambodian border. The camp's Green Berets, dividing their time between boredom and terror, are ostensibly led by a captain, the narrator of the story. But the officer actually takes his cue from an aggressive sergeant named Shotgun who is alternately crazy and wise, but always irresistibly, frighteningly dangerous. The altogether appropriate motto of A Camp is Normal is a cycle on a washing machine. Commanding officers issue orders that have no meaning; weapons are used in ways that are the grotesque opposite of their original design. And in an experience that has a real-life counterpart, the Green Berets stumble on a shocking alliance between the CIA and North Vietnam, something they realize they must destroy -- even at the cost of bringing both sides down on them.	288	March 1st 2002			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22178403-slow-walk-in-a-sad-rain

Set Goals. Work Hard. Be Persistent. That's the typical success advice you can probably repeat in your sleep. The type of advice that doesn't seem to work for you -- or anyone you know, for that matter."" You work your butt off, but at the end of the day, you're no closer to success than you were yesterday. The ugly truth is that it's not what you're doing that is holding you back. It's who you are. It's the baggage between your ears that keeps you from achieving your dreams and goals. That's why Dan Waldschmidt is changing the conversation about success. It's why you need to have an EDGY conversation. EDGY Conversations is a gut-wrenchingly honest, no-holds-barred discussion about what it takes to be success today. It's based on the stories of 1,000 ordinary people in business, math, politics, sports and science who achieved mind-blowing feats of extraordinary greatness. EDGY is how ordinary people become extraordinary. EDGY is how a master chef, a World War II veteran, a 15-year-old girl, a homeless retired paramedic, an Australian potato farmer and a shoe executive became amazing, did the unthinkable and forever changed their corner of the world. And EDGY is how you can achieve outrageous success, regardless of who or where you are in life right now. You don't need another book on success. You just need to be more EDGY.

Outcry - Holocaust memoirs		Manny Steinberg	4.46	2900	305	{5: '1786', 4: '773', 3: '263', 2: '47', 1: '31'}	"Outcry - Holocaust Memoirs, a Profoundly Moving AutobiographyMendel (Manny) Steinberg spent his teens in Nazi extermination camps in Germany and Poland, miraculously surviving while millions perished. This is his story.Born in 1925 in the Jewish ghetto in Radom (Poland), Manny soon realized that people of Jewish faith were increasingly being regarded as outsiders. In September 1939 the Nazis invaded, and the nightmare started. The city’s Jewish population had no chance of escaping and was faced with starvation, torture, sexual abuse and ultimately deportation.Outcry is the candid and moving account of a teenager who survived four Nazi camps: Dachau, Auschwitz, Vaihingen and Neckagerach. While being subjected to torture and degradation, he agonized over two haunting questions: ""Why the Jews?"" and ""How can the world let this happen?"" These questions remain hard to answer.Manny’s brother Stanley had jumped off the cattle wagon on the way to the extermination camp where his mother and younger brother were to perish. Desperately lonely and hungry, Stanley stood outside the compound hoping to catch a glimpse of Manny and their father. Once he discovered that they were among the prisoners, he turned himself in. The days were marked by hunger, cold, hard labor, and fear. Knowing that other members of the family were in the same camp kept them alive. Since acknowledging each other would have meant death, they pretended to be complete strangers.Manny relates how he was served human flesh and was forced to shave the heads of female corpses and pull out their teeth. Cherishing a picture of his beloved mother in his wooden shoe, he miraculously survived the terror of the Polish and German concentration camps together with his father and brother.When the Americans arrived in April 1945, Manny was little more than a living skeleton, with several broken ribs and suffering from a serious lung condition, wearing only a dirty, ragged blanket.This autobiography was written to fulfil a promise Manny made to himself during the first days of freedom. By publishing his Holocaust memoirs, he wants to ensure that the world never forgets what happened during WWII. The narrative is personal, unencumbered and direct.Outcry touches the reader with its directness and simplicity. The story is told through the eyes of an old man forcing himself to relive years of intense suffering. It is an account of human cruelty, but also a testimony to the power of love and hope. Memoirs worthy of being adapted for the big screen.""I read this book with a very heavy heart and tears running down my face. For Manny's endurance and his brother Stanley to be so tested is truly a testament to life! Bad people can do all the harm you want, but if one never gives up, the enemy will never win. Manny and his brother along with others, won. This is proven in this Holocaust book. A book well worth reading and learning from now and for future generations. It proves 'We will survive' ... Very well written as it goes straight to the reader's heart! The pictures are a treat, past, present and future, with a lovely tribute to his beloved, Mimi. Thank you for sharing 'YOU' with the rest of the world, Mr Steinberg! Bless you always.""""Manny Steinberg shares his extraordinary teenage story of surviving four concentration camps in an account noteworthy for its straightforward, unencumbered narrative. His is a story almost everyone can imagine happening to themselves - no less harrowing than more dramatic renditions of Holocaust survival, but somehow more compelling, and universal, for the unembellished simplicity of his style.""""You must read Outcry. You will have tears and joy how this young boy survived the six years in concentration camps in Poland and Germany. It is a hand-made story for a motion picture. Hollywood producers and directors, grab it. We must not allow this to happen again to human people."""	250	September 24th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23268862-outcry---holocaust-memoirs
How To Start a Business From Home		['Perry Belcher', 'Trisha Sebastian']	5.00	2	0		How to Start a Business is a conversational step-by-step guide to starting a small business. Inside you'll discover how to choose a business that's right for you, how to name your business, legal setup, leases, employees and more. The author Perry Belcher has started, ran and sold dozens of businesses and shares his experiences, mistakes and biggest breakthroughs.Does starting a business with a small amount of money sound too good to be true? No! There are many home based entrepreneurs who have successfully started their own businesses with little money. We’ve interviewed entrepreneurs who bootstrapped their businesses for as low as $500, yet they are now raking in money from their businesses. The lesson? Do things right! Of course, the ideal scenario is to start a business with enough money to enable you to move more aggressively and expand your business faster. But even if you do not have money, that should not prevent you from starting your own business. If you have great idea and a viable business plan, you can use Other People’s Money (OPM) to start your business. Or if you do not have access to OPM, you better learn how to tighten your belt and bootstrap your fledging business. Remember, while you may not be spending money, you still have to pay with something ­ your time and energy.Below are 10 areas Perry covers in his book:1. Think twice before borrowing. It would be ideal if you will not have to borrow money to start your business. After all, you want your own business to give you an additional source of income, if not the main paycheck. You do not need another bill to pay.But sometimes, you really have to borrow money to keep going. A major reason why many small businesses fail is inadequate capital. If you really have to, you must be prepared to take on the right kind of debt. Not all debt is bad debt. You have to ensure that before taking on a debt, you must see a way to pay it back through your business. As much as you want to be optimistic about your venture, there is always the possibility that your business can fail. Instead of fattening up your bank account, you could end up selling your house, your car and withdrawing your children’s college tuition just to pay off the debts. Be a smart risk taker.2. Be lean and mean. If you have limited capital, set aside any thoughts of a fancy store or great office. Start home-based and explore the advantages of working at home. Or if you must be “out there” selling your products, rent a small section at a flea market or fair. You may consider renting at the mall only when you see money coming in.In terms of legal structure, you can save tons of money by starting as a proprietorship. A Corporation is expensive to set-up, requires vast amounts of record-keeping, and will tax you twice ­ as an individual working for the business and as a corporation.Plus, you have to operate as tightly as possible. As a sole business owner on a budget, you do not have the luxury of wasting supplies, making unnecessary long-distance calls, and spending office money without a thought. Now every expense comes from your own pocket. Spend money only when you really have to. In fact, you can save tons of money if you select a business based on equipment that you already own. For example, consider starting a photography business if you already have your camera and photography gear. You may want to start a daycare business if you already have enough space in your house rather than spending money at the start of the business constructing new rooms in your house. If you must buy equipment, do so only when you have already landed your first account. Otherwise, consider renting it for the moment.3. Choose your business carefully.	79	March 25th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19377346-how-to-start-a-business-from-home

Christensen.In his international bestseller The Innovator's Dilemma, Clayton M. Christensen exposed this crushing paradox behind the failure of many industry leaders: by placing too much focus on pleasing their most profitable customers, these firms actually paved the way for their own demise by ignoring the disruptive technologies that aggressively evolved to displace them. In The Innovator’s Solution, Christensen and coauthor Michael E. Raynor help all companies understand how to become disruptors themselves.Clay Christensen (author of the award-winning Harvard Business Review article, “How Will You Measure Your Life?”) and Raynor not only reveal that innovation is more predictable than most managers have come to believe, they also provide helpful advice on the business decisions crucial to truly disruptive growth. Citing in-depth research and theories tested in hundreds of companies across many industries, the authors identify the processes that create successful innovation—and they show managers how to tailor their strategies to the changing circumstances of a dynamic world.The Innovator’s Solution is an important addition to any innovation library.Published by Harvard Business Review Press.	320	October 1st 2003			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2618.The_Innovator_s_Solution

Audiencia con el diablo		Víctor Hugo Morales	3.95	20	3	{5: '8', 4: '6', 3: '3', 2: '3', 1: '0'}	¿Por qué un empresario de la comunicación se atreve a denunciar a un periodista? ¿De qué manera puede entenderse que el dueño de un multimedios que se define como independiente, y que se dice defensor de la libertad de expresión, pretenda silenciar a un comunicador? El 8 de agosto de 2013 Héctor Magnetto, CEO del Grupo Clarín, debía verse cara a cara con Víctor Hugo Morales, a quien había denunciado ante la justicia. Aunque el encuentro entre ellos, en verdad, no se produjo, la situación reflejó como pocas el estado actual en materia de medios de comunicación. El 12 de junio de 1989 cambió la historia argentina. En La Rioja, el presidente electo, Carlos Menem, se reunía con Héctor Magnetto. Allí, juntos, delinearon el futuro del país. Desde entonces, y durante casi quince años, el Estado sería un esqueleto, devorado por las privatizaciones. Y Clarín resultaría uno de los mayores beneficiados. Para sostener las profundas desigualdades que han azotado América Latina desde hace décadas, es preciso contar con una poderosa maquinaria de construcción de subjetividad que legitime esas desigualdades. Los medios hegemónicos, con su arsenal de diarios, canales de noticias, radios y sitios de Internet, son esa maquinaria. Audiencia con el diablo narra con mirada atenta y precisa los mecanismos que los medios hegemónicos utilizan para perpetuar su dominio. Y lo hace con una escritura bella, muchas veces poética, pero llena de información y de análisis. Víctor Hugo Morales ha escrito un libro en el que las reflexiones sobre la política, el periodismo y el poder conviven con los recuerdos personales y su propia mirada del mundo. Audiencia con el diablo es un retrato vivo, urgente pero bien pensado, de la época que nos toca vivir.	320	May 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22257091-audiencia-con-el-diablo

A car accident changed her plans, but not her course, to lead a passionate and riveting life. From traveling through Southeast Asia on local buses to hitchhiking through New Zealand (yes, all in her wheelchair), Susan’s story is filled with moments of both pleasure and pain. Laughing, crying and rethinking what we do when life presents unexpected barriers, we journey with her around the world and through a realm of deep-felt human emotions, philosophical insights, and a life a social activism. Susan's unique philosophy on life, her “chutzpah”, and her life-affirming journey offer a page-turning experience of redefining how we see ourselves, see others, and live our own lives. “Loud, Proud and Passionate” becomes the battle-cry of women who have decided to create, through their own imagination, who they are and who they can be. Susan Sygall, a MacArthur fellow, shares with us the intimate details of her unconventional path.	270	October 1st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23977334-no-ordinary-days

More than three-quarters of a century have passed since the undetected mass murders of young women occurred. But the tragedy lives on in this fast-paced journey of discovery. Eugene Eris, the name inscribed on the two tombstones, haunts Sam at every turn. The beautiful geneticist Blair Tennyson helps Sam understand the how and why of genetic manipulation and the dark history of America's attempt to genetically improve the human species. Sam trusts no one except small-town waitress Annie George. But, like Sam, Annie is linked to Eris. Together they race to unearth the graves of a lost cemetery and to expose the mass murders of people who were involved in an experiment much larger and more sinister than Sam envisioned. Steven W. Horn's techno-thriller THE PUMPKIN EATER weaves a story of dark secrets while challenging readers to consider politically charged social issues as the novel races toward an unthinkable ending. The Pumpkin Eater, the nightmarish evil-doer of the past, haunts the present and lingers just below the surface of the future. Who is he? What has he done? Who are his protectors?

That -- at least -- holds true for Enim Lund, who finds himself in a psychiatric treatment facility after the events that took place at his boarding school the year before. Overly-watched and highly-medicated, he's supposed to be concentrating on getting better, but the only thoughts running through his mind are how to break out and find his best friend who was accused of crimes that he didn't commit. Though Enim maintains that he knows what happened, saying as much only makes the psychiatrists watching over him more certain that's he's falling back into his old delusions, and his uncle is positive that he's planning something far more dangerous than he's letting on. As Enim begins to manipulate the world around him in order to make room for the riddles that he so desperately needs to solve, he realizes that the further he goes to find the answers, the less and less certain he's becoming that he ever really knew what was real and what was not, and what appears to be the truth becomes something that would be better left unsaid.	686	January 8th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24424919-song-to-the-moon

Persephone in Hell		C.F. Joyce	5.00	3	2		"Troubled teenage Glory imagines herself a mighty queen, but discovers in her 1968 Massachusetts town that even queens have to watch their heads as savages await. Glory and her family move from Boston city life to rural cow country where people have heard of Jews but never seen a real one. A coming of age tale of a girl who doesn't understand why her sister won't talk to her and even Mother Nature seems out to get her. She cries out to the gods for help. But nobody sees her terrible self inflicted wounds. No one is paying attention. In this coming of age debut novel, C.F. Joyce explores the roles that family histories, clashing cultures, and dysfunctions play in the life of a young girl.  Under the unpublished title ""Memories of Glory"", the novel won a HarperCollins Top 5 Gold Medal award. Here are some of the reviewer's comments:  ""It is very difficult to approach a ‘coming of age’ story, and write in such a way as to not appear clichéd, but [the author] has made a remarkably strong case. In ‘Memories of Glory’, the journey from childhood to adulthood is dealt with in a unique way; the six children in Glory’s family are used to explore various different facets of growing up. The reader is also able to understand more about the pasts of Glory’s parents and their families, allowing adult tensions to be explored too. A compelling feminist take on life dominates, but the feelings of the important men in Glory’s life are not left uncovered. The memories she recalls do not depict a clear straightforward story, rather each is a part of a puzzle which in the end paints an often brutal but fair conclusion on life...Glory is set up well as a whimsical day-dreamer. She lives in an alter-world, and her intelligence and desire to be elsewhere helps build a strong picture of her imagination. Gradually it becomes clear that the world she fashions for herself is an escape from the harsh life that she has had to lead. As a protagonist she is wonderful; her suffering is a result of both her surroundings and of universal teenage trauma: I found her hugely accessible...The use of dialogue, and the focus on different characters in each recollection, allows the reader to build a strong concept of each family member, and their relationships with one another. This is a vibrant read, and no connection is left unexplored. Friendship, as well as sibling rivalry, is beautifully drawn out...The author clearly has a gift for wit and charm, illustrated in the passage where the family go blueberry picking...The role of “Mother Nature”, of fate and fortune, is an interesting theme and one that gives an interesting dimension to the family’s attitude."""	224	May 15th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24547109-persephone-in-hell

“I can tell you that some force within me rejected death at the last moment and then guided me, blind and stumbling—quite literally a dead man walking—into camp and the shaky start of my return to life.”  In 1996 Beck Weathers and a climbing team pushed toward the summit of Mount Everest. Then a storm exploded on the mountain, ripping the team to shreds, forcing brave men to scratch and crawl for their lives. Rescuers who reached Weathers saw that he was dying, and left him. Twelve hours later, the inexplicable occurred. Weathers appeared, blinded, gloveless, and caked with ice—walking down the mountain. In this powerful memoir, now featuring a new Preface, Weathers describes not only his escape from hypothermia and the murderous storm that killed eight climbers, but the journey of his life. This is the story of a man’s route to a dangerous sport and a fateful expedition, as well as the road of recovery he has traveled since; of survival in the face of certain death, the reclaiming of a family and a life; and of the most extraordinary adventure of all: finding the courage to say yes when life offers us a second chance.  Praise for Left for Dead  “Riveting . . . [a] remarkable survival story . . .

During that time, I travelled to over 60 countries, set foot on every continent, including Antarctica; worked in over half a dozen countries; and saw relics from ancient civilisations and technological marvels of the modern world. I saw the highest peak on earth, the lowest valley, and so much in between. I visited places where they had never seen a white man before and countries ruled by governances ranging from democracies to theocracies to military regimes. I saw the cruelty that humanity can have for each other as well as the love that can bind us all. I fell in love, had my heart broken a few times, and broke a few hearts of my own. ~Carpe Diem	280	December 31st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24640244-the-world-at-large

They’ve hated each other for years. Kode Sterling is the jerk who doesn’t care what anyone thinks. Tria Noles hides under a cold façade to appear strong and confident. There’s no possible way they could be anything together besides a volatile disaster. But when their chemistry overrides their logic, they have no choice but to face their twisted attraction to each other. When that attraction refuses to fade, what started off as physical turns into something neither of them expected — or wanted. Tria has spent most of her life living in her sister’s shadow, and it’s no secret that Kode was once one of the many who adored Rain Noles. It’s hard for her not to keep her guard up, because she doesn’t want to feel overlooked once again. Kode starts to realize he might have been chasing the wrong Noles girl all these years. And there’s a lot he did wrong in the past when chasing Rain that could jeopardize any future he has with Tria. There’s a thin line between love and hate, just as there is a thin line between success and disaster.	260	December 18th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23960397-loving-war

Every day, Paloma paddles her tiny boat into the ocean and anchors over a seamount—a submerged volcanic peak sixty feet underwater that is clustered with spectacular sea animals and a wondrous web of marine life. It is there that an astonishing event takes place, when on one of her dives Paloma is shadowed by a manta ray—an animal so large it blocks the sun.

Benchley’s novel paints a poignant picture of humanity’s precarious relationship with the ocean, which unfolds alongside a heartrending story of familial bonds, often revealing that the ignorance of man is far more dangerous than the sea.

BURNING DOWN ROME follows four friends on their spectacular journey to rock super-stardom.Hand picked by a record label at too young an age, they quickly came to understand that the business of fame was all a big game. Nothing was real. Sold out show after sold out show, autograph after autograph, screaming fans, television appearances and interviews in every major city, pushing through exhaustion just for the high they got on stage... Living the dream was all that mattered.Until the day arrived when not one of them could remember what the dream was about anymore.In spite of being caught in the maelstrom of unprovoked media attacks, vicious personal vendettas, and massive professional pressures, their band - Cry Baby Jake - brazen, bold and ultra-talented, ascended to the top of the rock'n'roll world where they held steady for six solid years. That's when the work related injuries - the behind-the-scenes mental torture, intense physical tolls and the hidden, soul-numbing truths of the industry that fans never see, set in.""Living the dream"" began to unravel for Cry Baby Jake's fearless leader, Aiden ""Kid"" Cade. His thoughts and emotions were drowned out by the millions of strangers crying his name - all of them believing that they knew him intimately, but to him were strangers. He lost his inner compass. He forgot who he was. Then he lost his ability to reason. And, a victim to inner demons he could no longer control, eventually, he nearly lost his life.One band member saw it coming. Another ignored the signs.And the third loved him through it all.While the world cheered for him, so loud he couldn't hear his own heart beating, behind the scenes Kid was poised between the band's overwhelming success and his feelings of crushing personal failure. In the midst of it all Kid fell in love, fell apart, melted down to almost nothing, and finally realized that making his way in a land of make-believe could either be deadly, or it could set him free. Burning Down Rome is the story of a rock'n'roll dream that became a nightmare for four unconquerable souls who nearly lost it all: Themselves, each other, and their passion... And who then reclaimed their destinies, and blazed beyond what the world said they were allowed to do."	470	September 25th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23501174-burning-down-rome

The Pacific Depths		Gary Paul Stephenson	4.07	15	9	{5: '6', 4: '5', 3: '3', 2: '1', 1: '0'}	KIRKUS REVIEWA billionaire’s attempts to make profound changes to counter global problems such as climate change are met with severe resistance from the U.S. president in Stephenson’s debut thriller.New Zealander Charles Langham, at a United Nations meeting, implores the U.N. to take more active roles in combating famine and the deforestation of rain forests and promoting alternative fuels. This plea includes a vague warning, giving the U.N. a week to comply or Charles will take action. It seems that U.S. President Mike Read, who views Charles as a threat to the American economy, may be the billionaire’s biggest adversary. President Read sends a U.S. ship after Charles’ superyacht, Sundancer, presumably to attack, and Charles responds by disabling the vessel with an electromagnetic pulse fired from one of his subs. Charles then makes a statement to the public that he plans to use a device to create two tsunamis (designed to inflict only “minor damage”)to hit the U.S., but Read soon sends a covert team to eliminate Charles. The novel embraces its climate change message by directly addressing the issue, and its suggested solution—Charles sends specialists to countries to help the people become self-reliant—is both practical and feasible within the novel’s context. America initially is the villain, but as the story progresses, it’s clear that the true antagonist is President Read, who gradually loses the support of other nations and even his own advisers. The bulk of the novel is essentially a showdown between Read and Charles, who seemingly has enough money and employees to be a viable opponent for a man who leads a country. There’s very little suspense, however, as Charles is never in any real danger; he’s protected by boats, submarines, “extremely well paid” security teams and a deep-sea HQ. He supplements his story by moving beyond the U.S. situation, including Charles’ team making a strike against a drug cartel in Brazil, and spotlighting strong characters—although the book is nearly stolen by Abbey, Charles’ border collie, who has more personality than his children, Cathy and Chris.Charles isn’t terribly charismatic, but his integrity and seemingly endless resources make for a great read.	226	April 25th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30729048-the-pacific-affair

Tyler Johnson, THE HOLLYWOOD GOSSIP This compelling and true life story screams of betrayal, deceit, and an unsolved mystery. It began when a budding young woman was lured into a cunning and deceptive scheme which eventually became her undoing. The tale may have gone unnoticed under normal circumstances. However, the plot thickened when a famous celebrity, Bill Cosby, was the target of a greedy rouse. The timing couldn’t have been worse as it fell on the heels of his son's murder. Ennis Cosby had been shot and killed the day an alleged extortion letter was delivered to the comedian demanding millions in hush money. During one of the most infamous trials of 1997 Cosby would face his adversary Autumn Jackson, and rue the day that she was born. Jackson could do nothing more than look into her father's eyes and weep for all that had never been. At least she believed the entertainer to be her father. This complicated and twisted saga is fraught with criminal and passion driven psychology. Who were the guilty ones and who were the innocents? “I’m Autumn Jackson’s aunt. I was called on to be her traveling companion, confidant, and unlikely bodyguard. When people asked me what happened, the answer was complicated. A book needed to be written.” Jewel Star 	161	January 1st 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24332065-cosby-s-love-child
Burning Entrepreneur: How to Launch, Fund, and Set Your Startup on Fire		Brad Feld	3.78	104	4	{5: '33', 4: '30', 3: '31', 2: '5', 1: '5'}	ABOUT THE BOOK  The Burning Man, the storied ritual of self-expression, has evolved into The Burning Entrepreneur, the ultimate self-expression through start-up success. Renowned tech investor and start-up guru Brad Feld lights YOU on fire with this insider's book that will teach you how to launch, fund and run your own company. If you're already an entrepreneur or have always dreamed of being one, douse yourself in “Feld Thoughts” and catch the spark. You'll be burning, entrepreneur, with this e-book!.  Brad's blog is a backstage pass to the 24/7 rock show that is tech startups. It is a master class in startup investing for givers and takers of funds. It is a rolling critique of tech products vast and simple (with enough edge to make the most scathing restaurant critic in Manhattan blush). And it is the journal of a peripatetic marathoner who still believes he will crack the four-hour mark someday.  From such Feld Thoughts, we have constructed “The Burning Entrepreneur,” the e-book on startups that you would take to a desert island if it had electricity, a decent Internet connection and angel investors. “The Burning Entrepreneur” illuminates the actions and attitudes required to launch, fund and ignite your startup. Brad Feld is on fire. Find out what happens when you stand too close.  TABLE OF CONTENTS - Introduction - Be on Fire - Be In Love With Your Business - Don't Be in the 99% - Ignorance Is Success - Meet the New Boss, NOT the Same as the Old Boss - Hire the Right People - It's the Product, Stupid! - Learning to Program: A Case Study - I Don't Hate Marketing: Neither Should You - OK, It's Really the Money, Stupid - Keeping Your You-Know-What Together - Burning Examples - Conclusion - Recommended Books for Burning Entrepreneurs  GREAT EXCERPTS FROM THE BOOK  It was during that car ride that my dad hit me with words that would prove to be fundamental for me: “If you aren’t standing on the edge you are taking up too much space.” Thirty years later that line continues to be a defining characteristic for how I live my life. I’m constantly pushing, looking for the edge of whatever I do. (pg 14)  Over time, I’ve learned that none of the short-term moves in the stock market matter at all in my life. It’s occasionally entertaining to turn on CNBC and see my friend Paul Kedrosky in the octobox telling all the other people that they don’t actually understand macro-economics, but it’s no different than watching McEnroe when he’s announcing a Nadal–Federer match. It’s just sport. (pg 33)  I don’t create products anymore (I invest in companies that create them), but I’m a great alpha tester. I’ve always been good at this for some reason — bugs just find me. While my UX design skills are merely adequate, I’ve got a great feel for how to simplify things and make them cleaner. (pg 58)  If you are someone who spends 30 minutes or more a day “organizing yourself,” I encourage you to step back and think about what you could change and how that might shift you from focusing on organizing to working toward outcomes. It’s liberating. (pg 103)  ...buy a copy to read more!	94	April 1st 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15733579-burning-entrepreneur

Way to Go		Alan Spence	4.21	167	14	{5: '71', 4: '67', 3: '22', 2: '7', 1: '0'}	Death is everywhere in this odd novel, a coming-of-age story that dissolves into notes from a funeral business. First US publication for the Scottish Spence.Neil McGraw is a lad in Glasgow, an only child, the son of a dour undertaker permanently embittered by his wife's death during childbirth. Whenever the boy misbehaves, he's locked in the basement among the coffins, so it's not surprising he asks every body: What happens when you die? Against his will, he finds himself learning the trade. This is less gloomy than it sounds. The story moves at a good clip as the resilient Neil experiments with drinking and dating.The crisis comes when his dad finds him and his girl making out in a coffin. Soon, it's Neil's turn to lock his old man, dead drunk, into the basement, before hightailing it to the London of the Swinging '60s. A friendly queer, Abe Morris, offers him a crash pad, no strings attached, where Neil finds drugs, straight sex, and Zen. The party ends when Abe, stoned, is killed in traffic and Spence abandons conventional narrative to send Neil hopscotching around the world before depositing him, 15 years later, beside the funeral pyres of the Ganges. Here, he gets very sick but is rescued by a vision in a sari: Lila, a Londoner, back home for her father's funeral. The two fall in love and marry, lickety-split, before Neil is summoned back to Glasgow. His father has died, leaving him the business, which Neil gives a hippie twist, producing brightly painted coffins in unusual shapes, with Lila a business partner.The mood is light and buoyant, but novelistic concerns (what makes Lila tick? why do the couple decide not to have kids?) are shelved in favor of a scrapbook of original last rites, seasoned with Eastern mysticism. There's an appealing freshness to Spence's writing; too bad he gives up on credible plotting and characterization.	294	June 3rd 1999	['Neil McGraw']	['Glasgow, Scotland']	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1304519.Way_to_Go

The Seventh Thunder		Larry Brooks	3.40	5	2	{5: '1', 4: '1', 3: '2', 2: '1', 1: '0'}	"When committed agnostic Gabriel Stone's wife dies in an unlikely airline disaster, he pours himself into the writing of a story that has haunted him since his youth-a novel his devout wife had warned him never to finish. Inspired by a visit to the island of Patmos, he is fascinated with the visions beheld there by St. John The Divine while in political exile for his beliefs. Those visions included terrifying events delivered by what John described as ""seven thunders,"" which he was instructed to withhold, to seal up and ""write them not"" (Revelation 10:4). As Stone becomes entrenched in his speculative interpretation of what those visions might have been, an embedded code within the Book of Revelation itself reveals startling connections to covert operations that are about to tear the world's political landscape to shreds, perhaps signaling the beginning of the prophesied end of times. As Stone's novel nears publication, he finds himself the pawn in a war between superpowers and supernatural forces, each hoping to control the book, each driven by hidden agendas beyond Stone's comprehension. Facing choices that are at once spiritual and life-dependent, with global stakes pivoting on his ability to accept the unbelievable and stop the unthinkable, The Seventh Thunder is a secular thriller that stops at nothing short of our very souls hanging in the balance, while ringing frighteningly relevant to today's headlines. Winner of the 2010 Next Generation Indie Book Award for best novel in the SUSPENSE/THRILLER category."	358	December 2nd 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22632259-the-seventh-thunder

Anderson's dazzling debut presents the haunting story of a world where something has gone horribly awry . . . Having escaped from Australia's Adelaide Zoo, an orphaned platypus named Albert embarks on a journey through the outback in search of ""Old Australia,"" a rumored land of liberty, promise, and peace. What he will find there, however, away from the safe confinement of his enclosure for the first time since his earliest memories, proves to be a good deal more than he anticipated. Alone in the outback, with an empty soft drink bottle as his sole possession, Albert stumbles upon pyromaniacal wombat Jack, and together they spend a night drinking and gambling in Ponsby Station, a rough-and-tumble mining town. Accused of burning down the local mercantile, the duo flees into menacing dingo territory and quickly go their separate ways-Albert to pursue his destiny in the wastelands, Jack to reconcile his past. Encountering a motley assortment of characters along the way-a pair of invariably drunk bandicoots, a militia of kangaroos, hordes of the mercurial dingoes, and a former prize-fighting Tasmanian devil-our unlikely hero will discover a strength and skill for survival he never suspected he possessed. Told with equal parts wit and compassion, Albert of Adelaide shows how it is often the unexpected route, and the most improbable companions, that lead us on the path to who we really are. Who you journey with, after all, is far more important than wherever it is you are going."	228	July 12th 2012	['Albert']		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13486177-albert-of-adelaide

House Of Hope International Cookbook		['Denise Marie Mari', 'Lynn Marie Knapke', 'Aaron Shaun Brennan']	4.33	3	0		Since its foundation, the House of Hope International* retreat center has cooked and provided meals for numerous religious order members in need of rest from their labors. In this unique context of retreat ministry and hospitality, House volunteers including Dr. Denise Marie Mari, Lynn Marie Knapke and Aaron Shaun Brennan have been blessed to learn much about saintly founders and friends of religious communities in the USA and abroad; and, in many cases, to receive stories through convent and monastery kitchen personnel.

Not only does this one-of-a-kind Cookbook contain religious order founder facts and original recipes but it also features special bonus material such as founder quotes, fun-n-easy songs to sing in the kitchen, food proverbs, cooking jokes, and religious order blessings or grace said with meals.

Creatures that once lived in the shadows, hidden from humankind, have risen, spreading like a plague across the globe over the course of a single night. Their numbers growing exponentially through infection, these seemingly unkillable creatures have swallowed up whole cities and collapsed unprepared governments.  Survivors call it The Purge.  Against all odds, a disparate group of survivors has emerged from that blood-soaked night that devastated the planet and reduced humanity to an endangered species. Among the survivors are two ex-Army Rangers, a businesswoman, and a third-year medical student. But surviving The Purge was one thing – staying alive is another matter entirely.  Hope exists in the countryside, in the form of a self-sustaining underground facility designed to withstand any calamity. But in order to reach its safety, the survivors must travel hundreds of treacherous miles, with the night – and the creatures that dwell within it – always at their backs.  The rules are simple: stay out of the dark, load up on silver bullets, and whatever you do, stay alive.

Solar Arc Directions		Carole Devine	4.63	43	5	{5: '36', 4: '1', 3: '3', 2: '3', 1: '0'}	"Very little has been written about solar arc in astrological literature. This book fills that need and is dedicated to isolating it as a major tool in showing turning points in people's lives. Although solar arc is commonly known as a reliable astrological predictive technique, this book goes further by describing patterns within the process.

Paradigm Shift: How proper organization and preparation are the back-bones of any trading success (Trading Easyread Series Book 1)		Yvan Byeajee	4.30	33	2	{5: '19', 4: '8', 3: '4', 2: '1', 1: '1'}	We all want consistent trading results, but how many of us have actually prepared for this? Trading is a highly competitive field and a very challenging endeavor where the learning curve is known to be very steep. The very nature of financial markets makes them uncertain and almost impossible to predict on a trade by trade basis. Hence, people who like to use their intellect to predict the markets are the ones who typically don't make it as consistently profitable traders. People who need to have that kind of certainty - not acting until they know what will happen next - are the ones who experience the most frustration because they are expecting something that the markets just cannot provide. And, in today's markets we are required more than ever to adapt and evolve in a manner that is quick and concise, if we want to acquire even the slightest edge. The Trading Easyread series targets the new generation of online traders who have an unquenchable desire to profit from the markets and who are willing to do the work necessary to achieve that goal. This book was written by a professional trader for beginning and intermediate level traders. Professionals will also find value in it as it can help them refresh their already acquired skills. The irony of all this is that, when your paradigm shifts - when you acquire a ‘trader’s mindset’ and, can remain confident in the face of constant uncertainty - trading will be as easy and as simple as you probably thought it was when you first started out. It is my hope is that the material presented in this book will bring you one step closer to that ideal mindset.	88	July 12th 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25642888-paradigm-shift

Austin, twenty-four years Mabel’s senior and married, was the brother of the reclusive poet Emily Dickinson, whose house provided the setting for Austin and Mabel’s trysts.Alice travels to Amherst, staying in the house of Nick Crocker, a married English academic in his fifties. As Alice researches Austin and Mabel’s story and Emily’s role in their affair, she embarks on her own affair with Nick, an affair that, of course, they both know echoes the affair that she’s writing about in her screenplay.Interspersed with Alice’s complicated love story is the story of Austin and Mabel, historically accurate and meticulously recreated from their voluminous letters and diaries. Using the poems of Emily Dickinson throughout, Amherst is an exploration of the nature of passionate love, its delusions, and its glories. This novel is playful and scholarly, sexy and smart, and reminds us that the games we play when we fall in love have not changed that much over the years.	289	February 10th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18775483-amherst

You probably don't.Managing Bubbie is the heartrending, hilarious family memoir by Russel Lazega that recounts the frequently hectic, ever-exhausting trials of one Jewish family in Miami Beach as they try to oversee the care of the elderly, unmanageable Lea Lazega. As they scramble for an acceptable assisted living facility and struggle to get her medication in line, they discover the difficulties of controlling a woman who time and again eluded catastrophe by refusing to be told what to do.
